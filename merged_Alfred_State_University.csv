http://www.alfredstate.edu	div		br	While researching Alfred State’s electrical major, Claire Wragg spoke with her cousin, who had previously graduated from the program. After getting a first-hand account of all the program has to offer, Claire came away convinced that the major was right for her. “Based off what my cousin had told me, as far as the knowledge she had gained from the program and how it prepared her for the field, I was all in.”

http://www.alfredstate.edu	div		br	In his 30-plus years of working for Shell Offshore, a subsidiary of Shell Oil, Lee Brasted carved out an impressive and prosperous career as a world-class engineer. The success he enjoyed in this field was largely founded on the solid education he received at Alfred State.

http://www.alfredstate.edu	h4			Alfred State is very veteran-friendly. 
http://www.alfredstate.edu	div		br	When former Army Master Sgt. Bill Buckner decided to attend college to learn building trades, he wanted some hands-on work, rather than sitting in a classroom all day, so he chose to earn his degree at Alfred State. “I didn’t want to write a whole bunch of papers. In the building trades: building construction major, you sit in a classroom for an hour or two in the morning and then you apply what you’ve been taught. Plus, you’re more active.”
http://www.alfredstate.edu	p			“We’re getting that hands-on experience that employers are looking for.​”

http://www.alfredstate.edu	div		br	After completing his service in the Marine Corps, Jordon Williams began researching colleges to attend. His search ultimately brought him to Alfred State. “It had the best program for what I wanted to do.” Williams, who planned on becoming a wind turbine technician after graduating from Alfred State, said the faculty helped him out tremendously, and that the college gave him the knowledge and confidence he needed to have when entering the workforce.

http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20155	strong			When Albert Styrcula entered the workforce in 1959, he was fresh out of college.

http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20155	p			He started out at Foodcraft Inc., a small processing and distribution company that dealt in dairy products. His jobs varied from accounting work to driving trucks to delivering milk to washing bottles.
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20155	p			However, by 1972, Styrcula had worked his way up to the top of Foodcraft, becoming CEO and chairman of the board, positions he held until 1988, when Uni-Marts Inc. acquired the company. During that time, the company’s sales increased from $2 million to $50 million under Styrcula’s leadership.
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20155	p			“I think my employees all respected me because I came from the ground up,” Styrcula said. “I got along very well with them.”

http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	strong			Travis is passionate about all things green—from renewable energy and resources to green building techniques.
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	p		a	Travis was attracted to the 
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	a			building construction major
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	p			 at Alfred State because of the incredible hands-on learning opportunities it offers. “I heard about how good the major here was, and it was really one of the few schools that offered it with both hands-on training and the green building aspect.”
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	p			He’s even taking his skills to multinational competitions. He has traveled to China for the 2013 Solar Decathlon and was head construction supervisor for the 2015 Solar Decathlon in California.
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	p		a	Travis is also a graduate of the 
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	a			technology management (BBA) major
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20159	p			. “Someday, I would like to be the head of a green building department in a large organization or start my own business where we focus on residential green home building and efficiency.”

http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20165	strong			An enduring and endearing presence
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20165	p			You may have seen her at an Alfred State sporting event, at Commencement, or exercising at the Orvis Strength and Conditioning Center.
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20165	p			Mary Huntington has had a strong presence at Alfred State and the nearby community since 1964, when she became first lady of the college after her husband, David, took over as the school’s seventh president. David Huntington, for whom the Huntington Administration Building on the Alfred campus is named, served as head of the college until 1986.
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/20165	p			“Alfred State really means a lot to me because David was president for quite a long time and we did a lot of things for the college,” Huntington said.

http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/21005	strong			"""Alfred State is one of my big loves."""
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/21005	p			Barbara Becker credits Alfred State with providing the foundation for advancement in her 40-year career in the business world, as well as the confidence to meet the challenges of everyday life. 
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/21005	p			"""Alfred State is one of my big loves,"" she said.  "
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/21005	p			At the time of her graduation in 1947, Becker was one of seven in the first graduating class of executive secretarial majors. A Corning resident, she soon began working for Corning Glass Works as secretary to the director of New Products and of the Centennial. 
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/21005	p			Her legacy at Alfred State can be found in numerous forms. She has purchased an alumni brick, as well as a bench and a perpetual garden in memory of her parents, Leo and Frances Becker, near St. Jude's Church, located on the Alfred campus. 
http://www.alfredstate.edu/node/21005	p			"""An investment in the education of our young people through gifts to the Alfred State College Legacy Society,' Becker said, ""is one of the best investments we can make for our families, communities, and our country.”"
