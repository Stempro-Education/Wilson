https://www.hchc.edu/library	p			Located on the top floor of the Library, The Archbishop Iakovos Collection is a permanent exhibition, installed under the direction of His Grace Bishop Andonios of Phasiane. The objects displayed constitute the personal effects of His Eminence Archbishop Iakovos that reflect the 37 years (1959-1996) of his archpastoral ministry and leadership of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America.
https://www.hchc.edu/library	p		a	Most of the objects within this Collection belong to the post-Byzantine and modern periods. A brief description of this Collection and its significance can be found in The Archbishop Iakovos Collection 
https://www.hchc.edu/library	a			brochure
https://www.hchc.edu/library	p			, prepared by Bishop Andonios.
https://www.hchc.edu/library	p		a	More recently, a number of Greek, Roman and Byzantine pieces that had belonged to Archbishop Iakovos were transferred to the Collection. These objects were first put on exhibition for the School’s hosting of the 38th Annual Byzantine Studies Conference, November 1-4, 2012, and will remain on permanent display as part of the Archbishop Iakovos Collection. Information concerning these objects can be accessed from the 
https://www.hchc.edu/library	a			digital catalog
https://www.hchc.edu/library	p			. In the near future, Archbishop Iakovos’ archive will also be maintained here.
https://www.hchc.edu/library	p			Individual and group tours are offered Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm, or by appointment.
https://www.hchc.edu/library	h3			VISITOR INFORMATION
