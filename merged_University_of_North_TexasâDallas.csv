https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	h1			Sexual Violence Resources
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	h3			Title lX
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p	h3		Sexual violence refers to physical sexual acts perpetrated against a person’s will or where a person is incapable of giving consent due to the victim’s use of drugs or alcohol.  An individual may be unable to give consent due to an intellectual disability or other disability such as being under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			Sexual violence can occur between friends, classmates, spouses, romantic interests, short acquaintances, or strangers.  Examples of sexual violence include rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, and sexual coercion.  Dating violence and stalking are also serious offenses.

https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	h3			Are you a witness to an incident of sexual violence?
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p	h3	strong	If you are a witness to sexual violence, you should 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			report the incident to campus or local police
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p	h3		.  You may also speak with the Dean of Students who can assist you with the reporting process.
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	h3			What to do if you're a victim
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p	h3		Unfortunately, no matter how well you prepare, it is impossible to protect yourself against every possible situation. If you are attacked, it is important to know what to do. The following steps will ensure you get help safely and quickly, and the resources will help you recover from the trauma. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			If possible, get to a safe place. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			In the event of an emergency, make sure that you move to a well-lit, populated area before calling for help. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			Call 911. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			As soon as it is safe to do so, call 911 or have someone call 911 for you. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			Follow the operator’s instructions until help arrives. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			911 operators go through hundreds of hours of training to learn how to handle emergency situations. They will instruct you until police or paramedics arrive. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			Let emergency services guide you through what to do. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			Depending on what happened, a number of tests or procedures may be required. The officers or paramedics should walk you through this step-by-step. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			Contact a trusted friend or family member as soon as you can. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			Not only do you need to let someone know what is going on, you should have somewhere to go after all the official procedures are taken care of. Emotional support will be very important. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	strong			Take care of yourself and take time to heal. 
https://www.untdallas.edu/svr	p			Becoming a victim can be incredibly traumatic. The healing process will take time and attention. There are plenty of free resources available to help you heal. See our resource guide below and be sure to check with your campus mental health services about how they can help in your recovery.
