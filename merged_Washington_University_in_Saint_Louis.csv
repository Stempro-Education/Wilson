http://artsci.wustl.edu	p	h3		Noah Cohan, lecturer in American Culture Studies in Arts & Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, and founding coordinator of the American Studies Association’s Sports Studies Caucus, examines contemporary sports culture to show how mass-mediated athletics are actually richly textured narrative entertainment, rather than merely competitive displays.

http://source.wustl.edu	a			‘Lost crops’ could have fed as many as maize
http://source.wustl.edu	div			   For thousands of years, goosefoot and knotweed were grown as crops, possibly feeding as many indigenous people of North America as corn. But the domesticated forms of these lost crops became lost over the years, and now a Washington University in St. Louis archaeologist is trying to figure out why — and recreate them.
