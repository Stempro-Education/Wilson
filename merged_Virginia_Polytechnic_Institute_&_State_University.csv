https://lib.vt.edu	p			Who can help me at the library? How many books can I check out? What support do you offer for data management? Come find out the answers to these questions and more at the Graduate Student Library Open House! Stop in any time between 2 and 4 pm to chat with representatives from across the library, ask questions, and learn about all the ways that the University Libraries support graduate students throughout their time at the university, from their first semester all the way to finishing a thesis or dissertation. We estimate that it will take around 30 minutes to visit all stations. Talk to someone at each station, and you’ll be entered to win a library prize pack. Snacks and drinks will be served.
