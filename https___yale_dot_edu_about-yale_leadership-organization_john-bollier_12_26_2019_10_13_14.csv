https://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/john-bollier	div			Vice President for Facilities and Campus Development
https://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/john-bollier	p			John H. Bollier was appointed vice president for facilities and campus development in July 2018.
https://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/john-bollier	p			In this role, he works with other university leaders to shape the facilities and campus projects that support the university’s academic priorities and initiatives. He also leads the university’s facilities organization that oversees the planning, design, and construction of campus buildings, and the facilities operation and maintenance of the university’s central, medical, west and athletic campuses—which together include over 500 acres, 380 buildings, and nearly 18 million square feet of space.
https://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/john-bollier	p			Mr. Bollier began his career at Yale in 1992 as a facilities capital project manager at the School of Medicine, later leading the school’s facilities operations and capital group. In 2003, he joined the Office of New Haven and State Affairs and Campus Development, eventually overseeing the planning and capital projects groups that serve the university’s campus. Serving as the associate vice president for facilities, Mr. Bollier led an organization of over 800 employees—including planners, architects, construction managers, engineers, tradespeople, utility plant operators, groundskeepers and custodians—that implemented over $4 billion in capital projects while continuing to support the university’s daily facilities-related needs.
https://yale.edu/about-yale/leadership-organization/john-bollier	p			A licensed architect, Mr. Bollier has worked for several Connecticut architectural firms, including Eero Saarinen’s successor firm, Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo and Associates. He earned a B.S. from the University of Michigan College of Architecture and Urban Planning and an M.B.A. from the University of New Haven.
