https://n150.unl.edu	p	header		When tractors and mechanized agriculture equipment began to be in wide use in the early 1900s, farmers and others were concerned that the equipment delivered what the manufacturers promised. The Nebraska Legislature enacted a law — one of the earliest pieces of consumer-protection legislation in the United States — that required all tractors sold in the state to be certified by the university.
https://n150.unl.edu	p			The Tractor Test Laboratory opened on East Campus in 1919. Over the years, thousands of tractors have been tested in the lab and the adjacent test track. In 1980, the building was designated by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers as a historic site, and named for Lester F. Larsen, the man who directed the lab for 39 years.
