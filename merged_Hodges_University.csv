http://www.hodges.edu	span			Student
http://www.hodges.edu	p			Hodges is a great experience. You can't procrastinate. You have dedicated, loving, and devoted teachers who give it their all. The learning environment is incredible; you feel welcome and want to learn. The education is not forced and everyone is loved. The teachers stick with you through good and bad and let you know you are somebody. It's a team effort and a great support system all year round. Hodges taught me to be more motivated and dedicated in all I do.
http://www.hodges.edu	span			Alumni
http://www.hodges.edu	p			I enjoyed the online aspect. It made it possible for me to go to school while working full-time and being a single mom. The workload was manageable and the professors were incredible. I would definitely recommend Hodges University to others.
http://www.hodges.edu	p			Hodges University has been an amazing school to attend. I have taken classes from full-time to part-time, switching back and forth over the past 5 years, while I work a full-time career.    While looking for classes to attend and confused of which classes were best suited for my degree, I came across a dedicated Hodges employee who has made the process easy and painless. Mrs. Jeanette Colon has been a godsend. She always makes time to help me, answers questions, and makes sure things get done in a timely manner. The dedication to her job is incredible and her enthusiastic ways help me continue to push through. I have even considered completing my Master's Degree because she is so encouraging.    Thank you for having Mrs. Colon as a staff member. I greatly appreciate her and her hard work.
