https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	a			How do I apply?
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	p		a	The majority of programs use the CGU application for admission. Public Health programs use the 
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	a			SOPHAS application
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	p		a	 and the Art Business and Arts Management programs use the 
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	a			Sotheby’s Institute of Art application
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	a			Do you allow students to attend part-time?
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	p			Yes. Many of our students attend part time. Domestic students have the option to enroll as full-time or part-time students. Full-time enrollment typically constitutes a course load of 12 or more units in a semester.    International students are required to maintain full-time enrollment throughout the duration of their degree program.  
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	a			Is there an advantage to applying by the priority deadline?
https://www.cgu.edu/admissions	p			Applicants who apply by the priority deadline are amongst the first reviewed for admission and considered for fellowship aid funding. We encourage applicants to submit their applications by the priority deadline.
