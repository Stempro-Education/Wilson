https://www.austincollege.edu/art	h2			Visiting Artist Exhibits and Events
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	p			The Art and Art History Department provides experiences in the practice and history of the visual arts, with a vibrant studio program that includes ceramics, film photography, digital imaging, drawing, painting, sculpture, and more.  We offer a major in Art with a Studio or Art History focus, and minors in Art and Art History. Our program affords students a broad base in the study of visual art by offering courses in a variety of media, as well as in art history. Students assemble these building blocks to serve their unique goals. The Art History program focuses on teaching students how to analyze and interpret art within historical contexts. Through its points of contact with literature, history, philosophy, religion, economics, music, biology, political science, and physics, for example, art history builds bridges between the visual arts and other disciplines. For those students who are interested in pursuing graduate work or a career in visual art or art history, we are able to provide a high level of individualized attention.
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	h2		strong	Why study Art at Austin College?
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	p			Our alumni apply their educations to a wide array of careers, including museum and gallery work, art education, art therapy, medical illustration, architecture, and even unexpected occupations like prosthetics design and custom guitar fabrication. Students who study art at Austin College do not just become skilled technicians; the skills and abilities learned by studying art and art history – creativity, problem solving, critical thinking, synthesis, and interpreting visual information – are all highly valuable, and serve students in careers both within and outside of the arts.

https://www.austincollege.edu/art	h2			Why Study Art & Art History?
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	strong		a	A note from the Chair, 
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	a			Dr. Jeffrey Fontana
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	strong			, Associate Professor of Art History
https://www.austincollege.edu/art	p			Through the making of visual art and its analysis in historical context, the Art and Art History Department develops and illuminates the creative human mind. Works of visual art may be generated deliberately as a means of personal expression, yet may also reflect subconscious desires. Pieces may result from individual motivations to document, comment upon, or even change the natural or social world, and they may also be shaped by external circumstances beyond artists’ control. Art speaks to the time of its creation, but it may also communicate to future generations. Our department assists students to experience and understand with greater self-awareness how humans create from their positions geographically, culturally and historically; how we forge new pathways while finding a place relative to existing traditions.

https://www.austincollege.edu/mlk-jr-celebration-2020	strong			About Herschel Walker
https://www.austincollege.edu/mlk-jr-celebration-2020	p			 Born into a poor but loving family in Wrightsville, Georgia, Herschel Walker was an overweight child with a stutter who suffered terrible bullying at school. Despite this adversity, he led both his high school football and track team to state championships. He scored a record-breaking 85 touchdowns as a running back, while maintaining an “A” average. In 1980, Walker participated in the Academy of Achievement program as valedictorian of his class.
https://www.austincollege.edu/mlk-jr-celebration-2020	p			Walker’s collegiate football career is legendary. He earned consensus All-American honors three consecutive years in both football and track & field, set numerous NCAA and SEC records and capped a sensational college career by earning, in his junior year, the 1982 Heisman Trophy. During his 15-year pro football career, Walker set the still standing, single-season, pro football rushing record of 2,411 yards; led the NFL in rushing; and received numerous All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors. Additionally, Walker held a world record in the 60-yard dash, participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics 2-man United States bobsled team, and is a fifth degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do. In 2002, he was voted into the Collegiate Football Hall of Fame and in 2015 was selected as the greatest player in college football in the last half century. In 2017, Herschel was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame and was also honored with the Doak Walker Legends Award.
https://www.austincollege.edu/mlk-jr-celebration-2020	p			In September 2009, Walker was signed to compete in Mixed Marital Arts (MMA) with Strikeforce (now UFC) to compete in their heavyweight division. Walker trained at the American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose, California. In his first MMA debut on January 30, 2010, Herschel defeated his opponent by technical knockout.In his 2009 autobiography Breaking Free, Walker shares the inspiring story of his life and diagnosis with dissociative identity disorder (DID). While some might have taken this diagnosis as a setback, Herschel approached his mental health with the same indomitable spirit he brought to the playing field. It also gave him, for the first time, insight into his life’s unexplained passages, stretches of time that seemed forever lost. He also gives voice and hope to those suffering from DID. Walker shows how this disorder played an integral role in his accomplishments and how he has learned to live with it today. His compelling account testifies to the strength of the human spirit and its ability to overcome any challenge.
