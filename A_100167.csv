In 2009-10, 62% of our full-time students enrolling                                              for college for the first time received grant/scholarship aid. Students may also be eligible                                              for student loans and work-study. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student                                              Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for Federal financial aid that includes                                              Federal grant, loan, or work-study assistance.
