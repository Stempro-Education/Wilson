https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology          that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy          applies to the Aquinas Web site and governs data collection and usage.          By using the Aquinas website, you consent to the data practices described          in this statement.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	span			Collection of your Personal Information
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail          address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Aquinas also          collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as          your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically          collected by Aquinas. This information can include: your IP address,          browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This          information is used by Aquinas for the operation of the service, to          maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use          of the Aquinas Web site.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information          or personally sensitive data through Aquinas public message boards,          this information may be collected and used by others. Note: Aquinas          does not read any of your private online communications.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites          you choose to link to from Aquinas so that you can understand how those          Web sites collect, use and share your information. Aquinas is not responsible          for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Aquinas          and Aquinas family of Web sites.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	span			Use of your Personal Information
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas collects and uses your personal information to operate the Aquinas          Web site and deliver the services you have requested. Aquinas also uses          your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services          available from Aquinas and its affiliates. Aquinas may also          contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services          or of potential new services that may be offered.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.          Aquinas may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business          partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases,          your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone          number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, Aquinas          may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send          you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All          such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to          provide these services to Aquinas, and they are required to maintain          the confidentiality of your information.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such          as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within          Aquinas, in order to determine what Aquinas services are          the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising          within Aquinas to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested          in a particular subject area.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice,          only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is          necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process          served on Aquinas or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or          property of Aquinas; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect          the personal safety of users of Aquinas, or the public.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	span			Use of Cookies
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			"The Aquinas Web site use ""cookies"" to help you personalize your online          experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page          server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.          Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the          domain that issued the cookie to you."
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save          you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned          to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Aquinas pages, or          register with Aquinas site or services, a cookie helps Aquinas          to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process          of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,          and so on. When you return to the same Aquinas Web site, the information          you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Aquinas          features that you customized.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically          accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies          if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience          the interactive features of the Aquinas services or Web sites you visit.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	span			Security of your Personal Information
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas secures your personal information from unauthorized access,          use or disclosure. Aquinas secures the personally identifiable information          you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from          unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit          card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use          of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	span			Changes to this Statement
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p			Aquinas will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect  company and customer feedback. Aquinas encourages you to periodically           review this Statement to be informed of how Aquinas is protecting your          information.
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	span			Contact Information
https://www.ai.edu/Privacy	p		a	Aquinas welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy.          If you believe that Aquinas has not adhered to this Statement, please          contact Aquinas at
