https://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			Greetings!  I’m Laura Renninger, Dean of the Ruth Scarborough Library and the Center for Teaching and Learning here at Shepherd University. Thank you for taking a moment to visit our site.
https://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			In 2009, we established a “Learning Commons” here at Shepherd – in essence, a one-stop shop where students can find assistance with writing, study skills, advising, the effective use of technology, and tutoring in any subject ranging from mathematics to foreign languages to music. And, a one-stop shop where teachers can find pedagogical and technological classroom resources and exchange ideas with colleagues; a place where excitement about learning permeates every corner, every hallway, and every room. The Scarborough Library, the “intellectual heart of the campus,” has provided us with the perfect spot.
https://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			Our mission to support teaching excellence and to foster learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom continues to flourish. In one centralized location one can now find all of the following resources and support programs: Academic Support, Instructional Technology, Assessment of Student Learning, Common Reading Information, the First-Year Experience (FYEX) Program, Faculty Development Workshops, New Faculty Mentoring, Academic Advisement Information, the Center for Teaching & Learning Library, the TRiO Student Support Services and Upward Bound Programs, and Career Services.
https://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			Please visit us soon and let us assist you with your learning needs.

http://catalog.shepherd.edu	p			The 2019-2020 Shepherd University Catalog outlines the university mission, vision, core academic policies and  procedures, degree programs and course structures within each program. The provisions within the University Catalog are not to be regarded as a contract between the student and Shepherd University. The university reserves the right to make and designate the effective date of changes in curriculum, course offerings, fees, requirements for graduation and other regulations, at any time such changes are considered to be desirable or necessary, and to apply these changes to all students or to designated classifications of students. University faculty and administrators provide academic advisement to students, but it is the student's responsibility to comply with university policies, including degree requirements.

http://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			Greetings!  I’m Laura Renninger, Dean of the Ruth Scarborough Library and the Center for Teaching and Learning here at Shepherd University. Thank you for taking a moment to visit our site.
http://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			In 2009, we established a “Learning Commons” here at Shepherd – in essence, a one-stop shop where students can find assistance with writing, study skills, advising, the effective use of technology, and tutoring in any subject ranging from mathematics to foreign languages to music. And, a one-stop shop where teachers can find pedagogical and technological classroom resources and exchange ideas with colleagues; a place where excitement about learning permeates every corner, every hallway, and every room. The Scarborough Library, the “intellectual heart of the campus,” has provided us with the perfect spot.
http://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			Our mission to support teaching excellence and to foster learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom continues to flourish. In one centralized location one can now find all of the following resources and support programs: Academic Support, Instructional Technology, Assessment of Student Learning, Common Reading Information, the First-Year Experience (FYEX) Program, Faculty Development Workshops, New Faculty Mentoring, Academic Advisement Information, the Center for Teaching & Learning Library, the TRiO Student Support Services and Upward Bound Programs, and Career Services.
http://www.shepherd.edu/ctl2	p			Please visit us soon and let us assist you with your learning needs.

http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	h1			Student Life Council
http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	h3			MISSION
http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	p			The Student Life Council (SLC) is responsible for recommending campuswide student life policies to the Vice President for Student Affairs, the President’s Executive Staff, and other groups that establish policies. It establishes committees to review policies and maintains permanent subcommittees including Family Day, the Performing Arts Series at Shepherd, Program Board, Student Recognition Day, and the Leadership Conference at Shepherd. Its membership includes the SGA president, Program Board president, six students elected at-large, two graduate students recommended by the Dean of the Graduate School, four faculty members elected by the Assembly, the Dean of Students, and five staff members appointed by the Dean of Students or the Vice President for Student Affairs.
http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	h3			MEETINGS
http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	p			SLC meets the 2nd and 4th Thursdays of each month at 5 p.m. in the Student Center. Meetings are open to any student who would like to attend. If you are interested in becoming a SLC board member, contact the Student Government Association.
http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	h3			ORGANIZATION RECOGNITION
http://www.shepherd.edu/slc	p			After an organization completes the “Intent to Organize” Form and returns it to the Student Affairs Office, the organizational leaders must go before the SLC to request recognition. Contact the Director of Student Development or the Secretary of the Student Life Council and ask to be placed on the agenda for the next SLC meeting. Be prepared to answer questions about your group’s purpose, goals, plans, etc. Once the Student Life Council votes to grant recognition to your group, you earn all the privileges and responsibilities of a club.
