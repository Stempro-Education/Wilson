http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	span			May 30, 2019
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p		a	Members of the William James College community shared an inspiring evening with 2019 Commencement Speaker, A. Kathryn Power, and Honorary Degree Recipients, Dr. Thea James and Michael Botticelli, on Wednesday evening. Power, James and Botticelli will each receive an honorary degree from the College during 
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	a			Commencement Ceremonies
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			 on June 1. 
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			At a reception held on campus on Wednesday, Power spoke on the importance of developing your own leadership philosophy. “You need to write it down and own it in your soul,” she said. 
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			James talked about one her most valued roles as an ER doctor — that every day she has the opportunity to change someone’s perspective, and navigate them forward to a space of calm, optimism and hope.
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			"Botticelli, who is the Executive Director of the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center, said that science and date are insufficient to move public policy because what changes public policy are people, stories and emotion. ""It’s critical to inspire a sense of hope in the people we serve,"" he said. "
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p		a	"“The individuals we will honor this year are extraordinary professionals who are both leaders in the behavioral health field and committed workers,"" said President Covino "
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	a			in a recent press release
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			". ""Their contributions have helped to reshape the way our region, and our country, approach behavioral health care."""
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			"He added, ""Where many people with their talent invest in their own success, these humanitarians have made a career out of investing in the lives of some of our most hurt and ignored fellow humans. It is an honor to recognize them as ‘Doctors of Humane Letters.' As our talented graduates move to meet the great needs for leadership and behavioral health care, These honorees stand as examples for how William James College hopes, and expects, them to serve.”"
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/2019_HonoraryDegrees.cfm	p			President Nicholas Covino closed the evening on Wednesday by reiterating what an honor it is for the College to honor these exceptional individuals.

http://www.williamjames.edu/news/pride-2015.cfm	h1			William James College represented at PRIDE 2015
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/pride-2015.cfm	span			June 23, 2015
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/pride-2015.cfm	p			More than 25 members of William James College assembled to show their solidarity and support for their LGBTQ communities. They marched, waved, and hollered their way through the center of Boston along with hundreds of other organizations, coalitions and groupings of supporters and brethren. Although it was their first year as William James College, a number of onlookers recognized our group from our presence last year.
http://www.williamjames.edu/news/pride-2015.cfm	p	p	span	The continued presence of William James College at Pride continues our efforts to be a visible, mobile and active force in our community. We hope that Pride is merely the beginning for our next year of activities and activism. If you would like to get involved, please contact our school's LGBTQIA Student Organization, the Rainbow Alliance
