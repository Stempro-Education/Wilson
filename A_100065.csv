http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	h3		strong	Concerned about more than just grades? 
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	strong			You could be a Saint.
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	p		strong	Aquinas College students (Saints) care about more than test scores and placement rates (though both are very good). Instead, AQ Saints strive to make our world a better place. As a small Catholic liberal arts college named for Thomas Aquinas, we don’t teach our students 
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	strong			what
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	p		strong	 to think, but 
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	strong			how
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	p		strong	. Our students learn to pursue truth, seek justice, live with passion and act with courage. Prayer, study, community, and service are the foundation of all our students do, and 
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	strong			our students do great things
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	p			. If you want to live a life filled not only with achievement but with purpose and meaning, you could be a Saint.
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	h3			Undergraduate
http://www.aquinas.edu/admissions	div			Aquinas College will give you the time and space to ponder new ideas, to dream boldly and without limit. And, most important, to question the role you can play in making the world a better, brighter place. The big lesson is this: You really can make all the difference in the world.
