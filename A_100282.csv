http://www.cbts.edu	h3			Called to the Desert
http://www.cbts.edu	p			Desert is more than geography.  It is a time of stripping away the sinful practices that obscure our vision of the good.  It is a time of self-examination that brings a renewed sense of mission in our lives. It is participation in the dying and rising with Christ that we professed initially in our baptism.

http://www.cbts.edu	h2			My Experience:
http://www.cbts.edu	p			I began with the thought that maybe a friend or two would join me in my driveway for conversation and s’mores. It turned into much more than that. Neighbors I had never met before, friends from the metro area and beyond joined my two children and me to gather around the firebowl to roast marshmallows and form relationships. What I learned was that we all need community. S’more Club is more than the sum of its chocolate and marshmallow parts. My seminary training has helped me add a label to what’s happening – we call it church.

http://www.cbts.edu	p			I left my teaching position to help revitalize my grandfather’s farm. I asked myself, ‘If farming were to become my ministry, what would I build?’ Central is helping me consider how to make the farm ecological, sustainable, and economically viable, as well as theologically responsible.

http://www.cbts.edu/apply-now	h2			My Experience:
http://www.cbts.edu/apply-now	p			I started with Central Baptist Theological Seminary in 2010 as a student in the MDiv program. I wasn’t sure then and I am still not sure now what God has planned for me. I have been transitioning from a career in science to a calling in ministry and the experiences, classes and personal relationships I have been a part of with CBTS have helped me in my Camping Ministry with ABC of WI as well as my work in my church as CE Director. I also commute an hour and a half one way to classes each weekend and I have been the recipient of some wonderful hospitality from fellow students. We truly are a community. I am excited to see what is in store and I know I have a great support team!

https://www.cbts.edu/apply-now	p			I left my teaching position to help revitalize my grandfather’s farm. I asked myself, ‘If farming were to become my ministry, what would I build?’ Central is helping me consider how to make the farm ecological, sustainable, and economically viable, as well as theologically responsible.

https://www.cbts.edu	h3			Called to the Desert
https://www.cbts.edu	p			Desert is more than geography.  It is a time of stripping away the sinful practices that obscure our vision of the good.  It is a time of self-examination that brings a renewed sense of mission in our lives. It is participation in the dying and rising with Christ that we professed initially in our baptism.

https://www.cbts.edu	p			After finishing my study at CBTS, I want to join the Business as Mission Agency to help those who are marginalized and poor to get appropriate jobs and become rehabilitated. I have come to realize what God wants from us in worship. If Jesus is the same as the marginalized and poor, then isn’t serving and loving them the same as serving and loving Jesus? I believe that the genuine revival of worship will begin when we serve and love the marginalized and poor – even as Jesus did for us. “I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me” (Mt 25:40).
