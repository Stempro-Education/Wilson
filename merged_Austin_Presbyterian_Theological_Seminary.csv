http://www.austinseminary.edu	em			How do you recharge?
http://www.austinseminary.edu	p			 A good long walk. Preferably 500 miles on the Camino. But 5 miles around Ladybird Lake is my local treat.
http://www.austinseminary.edu	em			Why did you choose your field?
http://www.austinseminary.edu	p			 In junior high school I started collecting church bulletins and printed copies of the ministers’ sermons. Why? What we did on Sunday mornings seemed urgent and I wanted to know more.
