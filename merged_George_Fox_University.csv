https://www.georgefox.edu	h2			Our Promise
https://www.georgefox.edu	h4			At George Fox, each student will be known – personally, academically and spiritually.
https://www.georgefox.edu	button			Read more
https://www.georgefox.edu	p			It’s the hope each student brings to the college experience. To be known by name. To be understood, valued, encouraged and uplifted.
https://www.georgefox.edu	p			At George Fox, to be known means that professors and staff connect with students in authentic ways – personally, academically, spiritually – recognizing that we all come to this place with different backgrounds, life experiences and dreams for the future. To be known means that students not only learn new ideas, they share their own. To be known means to be heard.
https://www.georgefox.edu	p			When students feel what it’s like to be known in this way, they become inspired. And that’s when real change happens. Knowledge moves from the mind to the heart. Careers turn into callings. Faith turns into action. And that’s why we begin with a simple promise, that each student will be known.
