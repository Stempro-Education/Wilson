https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Minor            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The African American studies minor is designed to provide students an overview of the history, cultural traditions, and political experiences of African Americans in the United States.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Learn More
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			African Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Major,            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			African Studies introduces students to the second-largest continent on the planet, which comprises over 50 independent nations and houses just short of a billion people. Culturally and ethnically diverse, Africa nonetheless is united by several social processes, including colonialism, transnationalism, and globalization. The African Studies major is one of six interdisciplinary majors within the International ​​Studies Program.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			American Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Master's,            
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              BA/MA,            
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Graduate Certificate            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			American Studies majors are sharp critical thinkers and skilled researchers who deliver astute analysis in person and in print.  Our courses attract students who are interested in a wide array of scholarly approaches from history, policy, and culture to law, economics, and education. Through texts, images, and sounds, the major provides a rich, multidisciplinary exploration of the American experience at home and abroad. American Studies also offers a master's degree, B.A./M.A option, and a graduate certificate in Museums and Communities.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Ancient Greek
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			A sequence of six courses develops linguistic skills for reading literature in ancient Greek, housed in the Classical Studies department.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Anthropology
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Major            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Anthropologists strive to understand cultural difference and social change. Why do people care about their heritages?  Why do they fight for the right to practice their religions? How are cultural traditions invented, maintained, and transformed? These are anthropological questions that demand understanding of the cultural landscapes that, as humans, we create and inhabit.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Applied Mathematics
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The applied mathematics minor is designed to provide students with a strong background in the areas of mathematics that are critical for addressing both the theoretical and practical aspects of real-world problems that arise in a wide range of applications and disciplines.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Arabic
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			We are proud to offer a unique environment to learn the fascinating sounds and script of the Arabic language and the beauty of its literature and art and get acquainted with the warmth and generosity of Arab cultures. A formal minor in Arabic at Trinity is available and courses in Arabic language may count toward the Plan B Major within Language and Culture Studies, and a minor or major in the Middle East Studies Concentration within International Studies as well as African Studies and Global Studies majors.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Architectural Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The architectural studies minor is intended to equip the student with an understanding of the built environment, whether it is a Greek temple, a skyscraper, or a city. The minor includes historical, technological, and artistic approaches to the study of monuments and cities.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Art History
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Trinity’s Fine Arts Department takes great pride in its Art History Program. While small enough to offer students individual attention, it is also worldly enough to endow them with a breadth of knowledge essential to a career in art and architectural history and their related fields. 
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Asian Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Asian Studies major offers an interdisciplinary framework for the examination of the societies and cultures of Asia. Students choose to focus on China, Japan, or South Asia. The goal of the major is a comprehensive understanding of the region of choice from historical, social, and cultural perspectives, but a thorough grasp of the interrelations among regions is also crucial. Asian Studies is one of six interdisciplinary majors within the International ​​Studies Program.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Biochemistry
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			A major in biochemistry can lead to a variety of careers besides research. These include the health professions, teaching, law, business, and management. A major in one of these fields is also an excellent preparation for a number of interdisciplinary areas including pharmacology, material science, nutrition and food chemistry, neuroscience, toxicology, forensic science, and art conservation. 
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Biology
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Biologists look at the marvels of the living natural world; they study LIFE. What we encounter in biology are the continuing consequences of events that began billions of years ago, yielding simple living forms capable of faithfully reproducing themselves. From this genesis evolved the many forms of life we recognize today. 
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Caribbean and Latin American Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Caribbean and Latin American studies major allows students to explore this vast region from a variety of perspectives, including history, literature, music, religious studies, economics, and educational studies. Faculty expertise ranges across South America, Central America, Mexico, and the Caribbean. In addition, Hartford itself represents an excellent window into the Latin American and Caribbean world, thanks to its immigrant communities from the cultures of Puerto Rico, the West Indies (including Trinidad and Jamaica), Brazil, and Peru, among others.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Center for Academic Advising
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Academic Center/Resource            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Center for Academic Advising supplements the work of individual academic advisors to help address students’ broad-ranging academic advising needs. Run by faculty, it is embedded in the Bantam Network and closely engaged with relevant campus offices: Student Life, Study Away, Career Development, Student Accessibility, and The Counseling Center. 
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Center for Caribbean Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Center for Caribbean Studies explores and celebrates the distinctive Caribbean character of the city of Hartford and the influence of Caribbean civilization on contemporary cultures around the world. 
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Center for Hartford Engagement and Research

CHER coordinates the work of five core programs and assesses Trinity’s engagement with the city.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Center for Teaching and Learning
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) works to promote effectiveness in teaching in all its dimensions. The CTL staff sees effectiveness in teaching as an essential component of a fully-realized academic career that also embraces research and/or creative productivity, service to students and the College, and membership in a co-operative, vibrant, and supportive intellectual community.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Center for Urban and Global Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Center for Urban and Global Studies (CUGS) is the first center of its kind at a top liberal arts college in the United States, and it offers curricular opportunities and research programs where students and faculty work together to better understand our new global society.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Chemistry
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The chemistry major at Trinity is structured to provide a balanced presentation of the five major areas of chemistry: analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical. 
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Chinese
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			"Students choosing a Plan B major in Language and Culture Studies may elect Chinese as either their primary or secondary language. We also offer a Language Concentration (""Minor"") in Chinese which gives you the option to develop linguistic skills and gain an appreciation of Chinese culture."
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Cities Program
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              First-Year Gateway Program,            
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Special Academic Program            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The Cities Program is a special curricular option for select entering students who are interested in making the study of cities – past, present, and future – an important part of their liberal arts experience. We view cities from a broad range of perspectives in the humanities and social sciences, drawing on insights from history, architectural history, literary and cultural studies, anthropology, economics, environmental science, geography, politics, sociology, and urban planning, among other fields.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Classical Antiquity
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Students in the classical antiquity minor acquire a general knowledge of the achievements of ancient Greece and Rome, which traditionally have constituted, along with the Judeo-Christian tradition, the chief ingredients of Western civilization. Homer, Plato, Cicero, and Caesar remain lively figures, and the classical tradition still pervades our poetry and prose, our philosophy and law, our ideas of history, our conceptions of education, and our art and architecture.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Classical Studies
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Trinity's Department of Classical Studies guides students in exploring a world both familiar and foreign to us today:  the ancient Mediterranean world, as seen primarily through the lens of ancient Greeks and Romans. Our faculty,  in collaboration with colleagues in several other departments, offer courses in languages, literature, performance,  art, architecture, archaeology, history, and philosophy of the peoples and societies whose interactions created a rich  network of cultural traditions whose legacy has continued to reverberate through the millennia.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Classical Tradition
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Take a mixture of courses that focus on the ancient Mediterranean world and others that focus on the modern reception of “classical antiquity” through literature, performance, visual art, film, historiography, philosophy, political theory and practice, and/or Romance languages.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Cognitive Science
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary study of the human mind. The minor explores the fields of psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Community Action
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			              Minor,            
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			If you ask questions such as “How can we challenge social inequalities?” or “What can people like me do to make a difference?,” then you’re a good match for the Community Action offerings. The Community Action Gateway offers first-year Trinity College students the opportunity to engage with the City of Hartford through community-based research and social change projects. The Community Action minor is designed to engage students in both academic and practical work that addresses the meanings of citizenship, democracy, and community locally and globally.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Community Learning Initiative
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Students, faculty, and Hartford-area community organizations come together in collaborative partnerships to carry out projects that both strengthen student learning and benefit the community. Each project is part of an academic course and is guided by the principles of reciprocity and mutual respect between the community and student partners.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Computer Science
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			Computer science is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing fields today. We are dedicated to providing an education based on the development of the fundamental logic and reasoning skills and computational problem-solving skills that will prepare you for a lifetime of learning.
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Economics
https://www.trincoll.edu	div			The world of economics thus encompasses fundamental institutions and activities that govern “economic” outcomes—prices of goods, the amount of private and public investment, the wealth or poverty of nations and persons, unemployment rates, the structure of organizations, the benefits and burdens of globalization and trade, the quality of the environment and health care, etc.  We use this way of thinking to understand how different institutions promote or retard growth, the effects of differing monetary and fiscal policies, markets for health, labor, environmental goods, investments and invention, financial assets, trade; yes, even sports and art.  
https://www.trincoll.edu	span			Educational Studies

The major involves faculty from the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Philosophy, and Psychology
http://www.trincoll.edu	span			Philosophy
http://www.trincoll.edu	div			Socrates once said, “I am a lover of divisions and collections,” and that is a good brief summary of what it means to be able to think critically and imaginatively: to analyze (“divide”) arguments for their soundness and validity, and to synthesize (“collect”) them into a more comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand. That ability is something Trinity’s philosophy majors all master in time. Upon graduation, they take with them more than a diploma. They take with them a skill critical to the success of most endeavors.
