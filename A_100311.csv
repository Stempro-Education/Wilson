http://www.cks.edu/news	div			As we begin the season of Advent and a new liturgical year, the faculty, staff, and students of Christ the King Seminary would like to offer you a blessed season of hope and joyful waiting on the coming of the Lord! We also believe this new beginning of a season of expectation is the perfect opportunity to give you a brief description of seminary life today as compared to around fifty years ago, as well as offer you a glimpse into changes that will be forthcoming. Our purpose is to provide a clear portrayal of seminary life, while giving you some useful information to share with others.
http://www.cks.edu/news	a			Called to Be Healed
http://www.cks.edu/news	div			Wed, Dec 5th 2018 09:00 am
http://www.cks.edu/news	div			The call of God changes for each time and place. For our time in this area of Western New York, we have received God's call to enter a gut-wrenching period of healing, not just for the Catholic Church, but for all of society. The seminarians, deacon candidates, and lay men and women who study for ministry at Christ the King Seminary have heard this call and are responding in faith. They are aware their response calls for compassionate listening and humble witness so that the Good News of Christ's resurrection may heal and creatively transform our wounded world.
