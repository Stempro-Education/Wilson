https://csu150.colostate.edu	h2			The buildings are new. The purpose is eternal.
https://csu150.colostate.edu	p	h2		From the beginning, Colorado State University has been a place of purpose: teaching, research, service, and outreach focused toward building a better society. Now, 150 years strong, campus looks much different than the original, but our mission is still the same. Take a look at the places, people, and discoveries that define us. 
https://csu150.colostate.edu	h2			Celebrating our past while looking forward.
https://csu150.colostate.edu	h4	h2		In 1862, Vermont congressman Justin Smith Morrill introduced legislation, later signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln, that donated public land to states to create colleges open to all throughout our fledging nation.
https://csu150.colostate.edu	p	h4		The aim of this land grant was to make higher education available to all social classes. Eight years later – and six years before it achieved statehood – Colorado chose Fort Collins as the home for the state’s land-grant school, and Colorado Agricultural College was born. Now, 150 years after that announcement, Colorado State University has become a leading research institution dedicated to the land-grant mission of educating students from across the globe with the goal of improving people’s lives throughout Colorado, the nation, and the world.  So, join us as we celebrate our sesquicentennial with a look at our past and present and into a brilliant future.
https://csu150.colostate.edu	h2			Land Acknowledgement
https://csu150.colostate.edu	h3	h2		Colorado State University acknowledges, with respect, that the land we are on today is the traditional and ancestral homelands of the Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Ute Nations and peoples.
https://csu150.colostate.edu	p	h3		This was also a site of trade, gathering, and healing for numerous other Native tribes. We recognize the Indigenous peoples as original stewards of this land and all the relatives within it. As these words of acknowledgment are spoken and heard, the ties Nations have to their traditional homelands are renewed and reaffirmed.
https://csu150.colostate.edu	p	p		CSU is founded as a land-grant institution, and we accept that our mission must encompass access to education and inclusion. And, significantly, that our founding came at a dire cost to Native Nations and peoples whose land this University was built upon. This acknowledgment is the education and inclusion we must practice in recognizing our institutional history, responsibility, and commitment.
