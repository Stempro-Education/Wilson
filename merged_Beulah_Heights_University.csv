https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h5			 . Check option is available only on demand.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			Beginning Fall 2014, Financial aid refunds will be direct deposited into your personal bank account. Sign up using your Beulah Heights University user name and password and complete the requested banking information form. It’s that simple.  If you change banks, go back to the sign-up page and change the information. When a deposit is made to your bank account you will be advised by e-mail. Enter your banking information carefully, incorrect accounts and routing numbers will delay deposits.  All financial aid refunds will be issued via Direct Deposit. Failure to register for Direct Deposit may result in a delay in the issuance of your refund. Find out more detailed information, or register for Direct Deposit.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			Note:  If you are employed by Beulah Heights University, you will need to complete an additional and separate Direct Deposit form through the office of Payroll and Employee Benefits.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h3			Frequently Asked Questions
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h5			How will the money be sent to the bank?
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			The funds will be sent electronically through the banking system in the same manner as direct deposit payroll. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) is safe, timely, and convenient - NO MORE LOST MAIL.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h5			Are there any reasons why the money would not be deposited to the bank?
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			If you close your bank account without providing a new authorization, the transfer will be rejected by your bank and will delay your refund. A direct deposit can also be rejected if you entered an incorrect bank account number.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h5			Can I designate more than one account for Direct Deposit? Can the money go to my parent’s account?
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			No, all funds must be deposited in one checking or savings account in your name. Excess funds from Parent PLUS loans will be issued by check to the borrower.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h5			What if my account is at an out-of-state bank?
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			Direct Deposit can go to any financial institution within the United States.
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	h5			When should I sign up?
https://www.beulah.edu/direct	span			You should submit your authorization online immediately. If you currently have a credit on your account, a direct deposit refund will be issued in two business days of signing up for direct deposit.

https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	h2			How to Open a Bank Account
https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	span			Although many banks advertise that you can open an account over the phone or online, you should plan to open an account in person. As an international student, you do not fit neatly into any category set by US banks, and it will be easier to deal with any complications in person. In addition, it’s always useful to establish a face to face relationship if you require additional services. When you go to the bank to open a bank account, you will need to bring:
https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	span			Your full name, home address, home telephone number, your campus telephone number, and your college address (Letterhead showing the local address – i.e. utility bills or apartment contract)
https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	span			I-20, DS-2019 or I-797 approval notice
https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	span			Any secondary form of identification (such as: your passport, your Student ID card, birth certificate, state driver’s license, or a letter from the International Students and Scholars Office)
https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	span			Enrollment verification letter from your school
https://www.beulah.edu/studentlife101	span			You will also need the funds you want to deposit and open the account with. Every bank has slightly different requirements, so make sure you ask beforehand so you don’t forget something you need.
