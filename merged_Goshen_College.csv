http://www.goshen.edu/rfc	h2			Availability
http://www.goshen.edu/rfc	p		a	Some areas of the RFC may be closed for Goshen College athletics (home games, team practices, etc.) at certain times, so it’s a good idea to

http://www.goshen.edu/rfc	li			The Crossroads League Conference that Goshen College Athletics compete in is beginning a move to basketball games being played as doubleheaders with the Women’s and Men’s games played back to back.
http://www.goshen.edu/rfc	li			The conference also mandates we offer locker rooms for each team from 1.5 hours before the game until 1 hour afterward that are to be locked and secured for each team. Please be aware that this may result in all of our locker rooms being used and unavailable at times on game days/nights.
http://www.goshen.edu/rfc	li			The track and gym will also be closed during these times.
