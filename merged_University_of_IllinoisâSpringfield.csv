https://www.uis.edu/cspl	p		a	UIS Senior Tyler Brown of Quincy, IL, recently went on his first prison legal visit and finally got to meet an 
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	a			Illinois Innocence Project (IIP)
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	p		br	 client whose case he has been working on over the past year. “It was incredible to meet him. He was nervous but sat calmly while the attorneys talked to him about every detail of his case. It was definitely a learning experience for me.”
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	p			 Tyler was inspired to volunteer for IIP when he learned about prosecutorial misconduct in UIS’ Conviction of the Innocent class, taught by Project attorneys. “I was shocked by how some prosecutors choose to use false testimony by ‘jailhouse snitches’ to make a case against an innocent person.” Tyler will learn about another aspect of the criminal justice system by joining IIP’s policy team. He will track legislation emerging in the 2020 General Assembly that may threaten the prevention of wrongful convictions. After graduation in May, Tyler plans to take the LSAT with the goal of beginning law school in fall 2021.

https://www.uis.edu/cspl	strong			New Book on Capital Management
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	strong			 Co-Authored by Center Staff
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	figcaption	a		Published by IGI Global. (https://www.igi-global.com/)
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	p			This book describes, compares, and evaluates public infrastructure investment policy and practices in twelve countries based on principles recommended by public finance experts. The book finds that the best performers have a skilled workforce recruited through merit-based systems, are situated in relatively less corrupt countries, and are where decision makers are more saving- and investment-oriented. As an outcome of stronger strategic public infrastructure spending processes, these best performers tend to invest in public infrastructure networks more than other countries and are more efficient in their investment. Lead co-author Dr. Awri Srithongrung is a research fellow with the Center’s new Institute for Illinois Public Finance.
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	strong			Center Releases New Statewide Survey
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	p			The 2018 Illinois Issues Survey is the first in a planned long-term project which examines the policy preferences of Illinoisans. The study examines policy issues relevant both at the state and national levels across a wide variety of areas. Questions pertaining to immigration, gun control, taxes and the economy, and education policy are asked. The study is designed in a such a way that the interested public and policy makers can make use of the results, which are representative of registered voters in Illinois.
https://www.uis.edu/cspl	p			This report references the overall results of the study (which can also be found in the “Topline” appendix on pg. 24) and compares results across a variety of demographic groups such as geography, political affiliation, and ethnic background. A total of 717 registered Illinois voters were surveyed in July and August, 2018 by telephone researchers at UIS. The margin of error for the survey is   3.7% at the 95% confidence level. A brief methodological report is appended on pg. 23.
