It is our prayer that no matter at what level of spiritual development community members find themselves, chapel will minister to them, challenge them with the Good News of Jesus the Christ, and transform them.

http://snu.edu/chapel	p			This is a student-led worship service that takes place on some Thursday Evenings at 9pm. Our Student Government Campus Ministries team leads this service in various places around campus. Students can get involved in preaching, sharing testimonies, leading worship, and more. This service counts towards chapel credits and is another opportunity to worship together.
http://snu.edu/chapel	p			Solace is a worship service held by our University Pastors on Fridays at 1pm in the prayer chapel. It is meant as a time to rest and re-center upon the one truth that is Jesus Christ. With schedules consistently being busy for our students, our hope is that the Solace service will be a time of prayer, rest, and rejuvenation. A typical service will include times of singing, times of prayer, a time of communion, and times of silence for reflection.
