https://ocac.edu	p			In February, the Oregon College of Art and Craft Board of Trustees approved a resolution to terminate all degree programs at the end of May 2019. After exploring a multitude of options to continue OCAC’s 112-year legacy, the Board determined closure is the only responsible path forward.
https://ocac.edu	p			At this time, we are working diligently to ease our students into new institutions that fit their needs, and to help faculty and staff transition to the next phase of their academic and professional lives.
