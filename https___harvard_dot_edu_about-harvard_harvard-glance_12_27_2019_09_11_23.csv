https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p		a	The name Harvard 
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	a			comes from the college’s first benefactor
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p			, the young minister John Harvard of Charlestown. Upon his death in 1638, he left his library and half his estate to the institution established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	h3			Harvard and the Military
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p		a	Members of Harvard University’s “Long Crimson Line” have served in the United States Armed Forces since before the nation’s independence. Harvard counts among its graduates 18 Medal of Honor recipients, more than any other institution of higher education except the United States Military and Naval Academies. Buildings and sites around campus are daily reminders of Harvard’s deep military history. General George Washington kept headquarters at Wadsworth House before taking command of the revolutionary troops in 1775, Massachusetts Hall and Harvard Hall were used as barracks, and building materials were repurposed to make musket balls during the War of Independence. Memorial Hall and Memorial Church honor the sacrifice of Harvard men and women who “freely gave their lives and fondest hopes for us and our allies that we might learn from them courage in peace to spend our lives making a better world for others.” In 2011, Harvard 
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	a			welcomed the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) program back to campus
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p		a	, followed thereafter by the full complement of 
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	a			Army
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p		a	 and 
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	a			Air Force
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p			 regiments.
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	h3			Mission Statement
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	p			Harvard University (comprising the undergraduate college, the graduate schools, other academic bodies, research centers and affiliated institutions) does not have a formal mission statement.

https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance	a			mission of Harvard College
