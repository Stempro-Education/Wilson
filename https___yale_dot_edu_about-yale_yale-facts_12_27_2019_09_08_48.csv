https://yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts	p			Faculty with appointments in multiple Yale schools are counted only once in this table and are included in the school where they hold their primary appointment. As a result, the numbers listed for any one school may not fully represent the entire body of faculty who teach and work with students in that school.
https://yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts	p			In the Schools of Music and Drama, adjunct professors provide the core of the schools’ regular faculty. As a result, the distinction among the categories of tenured/term/non-ladder is less relevant in those schools.
https://yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts	p			In 2018 the additional category of Ladder-Continuing was added to the table. Ladder/Continuing category counts Law, Medicine and Nursing ladder faculty who are not on the tenure track.
https://yale.edu/about-yale/yale-facts	p			Faculty in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are counted within the Faculty of Arts & Sciences.
