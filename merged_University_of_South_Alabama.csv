http://www.usouthal.edu/research	p			The University of South Alabama is fortunate to be strategically located in an international                         commercial hub, providing unprecedented opportunities for scholars and students to                         explore the frontiers of their fields. Given the University's coastal location, its                         many innovations in marine science, coastal weather forecasting and research, coastal                         resilience and environmental fields are not surprising. USA researchers are also creating                         new nanomaterials, attracting the interest of Mobile's burgeoning aerospace industry.                      
http://www.usouthal.edu/research	p			At South, undergraduate and graduate students have opportunities to work with faculty                         researchers in a wide range of areas, from medical research, to engineering, to sociology                         to music. As the region's premier healthcare provider, USA continually generates medical                         research aimed at improving the quality of life. At the same time, USA's cybersecurity                         experts are working hard to stay ahead of the hackers, and the USA Technology & Research                         Park is home to a technology incubator for new tech businesses.
