http://alumni.mcphs.edu	span			MCPHS University announced this week that Elizabeth Chen, the Secretary of Elder Affairs for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, will address the University’s graduates at its 15th December Commencement at the DCU Center in Worcester on December 12. More than 360 students from the Forsyth School of Dental Hygiene, the School of Medical Imaging and Therapeutics, the School of Nursing, and the School of Physician Assistant Studies will participate in the ceremonies, and more than 1,000 family members and friends are expected to attend.
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	h3			Battling a Crisis Head-on: Physician Assistant Studies Faculty Beth Geralds Recognized by DEA 
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	span			Beth Geralds, MPAS, PA-C, is an assistant professor in the School of Physician Assistant Studies, and in just a few years has become an integral member of the MCPHS community.

http://alumni.mcphs.edu	h3			How to save a life with the HEENT exam: an interprofessional discussion
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	span			“Open your mouth and say ‘ah’.” It’s one of the most familiar refrains in all of medicine. But this deceptively simple instruction is actually part of one of the most complex and crucial diagnostic sequences that a physician can run. The HEENT exam (or Head, Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat exam), when performed carefully, can reveal vast amounts of information about a patient’s current condition, allowing an observant healthcare provider to catch anything from an incipient stroke to a dangerous drug interaction. On November 21, Padmastuti Akella, MD and Mohamed Hassan, MD, two residents from nearby Saint Vincent Hospital, visited the Worcester campus to engage in an interprofessional learning session with the pharmacy faculty and students. “The goal here is for our students to learn exam techniques from the medical residents, and for the medical residents to learn about drug-induced toxicities of the eyes and ears from the pharmacy faculty and students,” said Karyn Sullivan, PharmD, MPH, RPh, Director of Interprofessional Education and Professor of Pharmacy Practice on the Worcester campus. Together with Linda Spooner, PharmD, RPh, BCPS, FASHP, FCCP, Professor of Pharmacy Practice, Sullivan co-facilitated the meeting, which was joined by Manchester pharmacy students via livestream.
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	h3			The Universal Language of Healthcare: Physical Therapy students accompany Ann Charrette on the trip of a lifetime
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	span			Ann Charrette, PT, DPT, MS, PCS, NCS, Professor of Physical Therapy, recently took a sabbatical that might surprise you. Instead of retreating to a quiet writing nook or a lab, the adventurous professor took seven Physical Therapy students, along with Nicole Dettmann, DSc, MPH, PA-C, Associate Program Director, Associate Professor, Director of Clinical Education, to Rurrenabaque, Bolivia, on a service trip designed to help some of the country’s poorest patients. The students offered their services at an outpatient rehabilitation clinic; at a school, where they performed over a hundred screenings for gross and fine motor delays; and on a series of home visits to disabled patients of the rehab clinic. Along the way, they absorbed valuable lessons about providing culturally sensitive care; working across language barriers; and providing creative care to patients when resources are limited. Below, you’ll find a selection of photos taken by Charrette, Dettmann, and their students, along with some of the reflections captured on the students’ anonymous surveys after the trip.
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	h3			In Search of a Song: Peter Shostak BSP ’48
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	span			MCPHS alumni Peter I. Shostak BSP ’48 worked as a pharmacist, but left behind a musical legacy. A journey through the then-Massachusetts College of Pharmacy’s historical press clippings file reveals a profile of Shostak, originally published in the July 17, 1957 Bridgeport Telegram. “Regular customers at Peter’s Pharmacy, a neighborhood store at North and Lexington avenues, are never surprised when they find a batch of original music spread on the prescription counter and the proprietor busy with composition,” reported William Lamale, a regular writer for the paper. He went on to describe Shostak as, charmingly, a “genial pharmacist, a stocky man with an expressive face and arms that are always gesticulating.” As Shostak worked, he also wrote songs, scouring the conversations around him for overheard snippets that could form the nuclei of new lyrics. A stray comment from a customer could send him scrambling for a pencil and paper. But Shostak was not just a gifted hobbyist—his work made it to the hotbed of musical innovation known, at the time, as Tin Pan Alley.
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	h3			Cardinals gather at the Optometry Alumni & Friends Reception in Orlando 
http://alumni.mcphs.edu	span			The Academy 2019 Orlando and 3rd World Congress of Optometry held October 23-27 at the Orange County Convention Center included many opportunities for the nation’s eye health experts to update their skills and gain new knowledge. But for MCPHS alumni, the annual gathering offered a hidden bonus: the chance to reconnect with classmates and professors in a joyful, reunion-like atmosphere. More than 60 alumni, faculty, and current students attended the informal gathering, including the school’s very first valedictorian, Capt. Burke Manning OD ‘16 MPH ‘16, USAF, BSC, Operational Optometry Chief (and subject of an upcoming Alumni Spotlight—stay tuned!) A good time was had by all, and plans were discussed to hold a similar get-together next year, when the world congress will gather in Nashville, TN. Count us in!

As a student, this has led me to some amazing opportunities, like volunteering at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a research position at the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute, and a fellowship research position at the Wyss Institute, which is part of Harvard Medical School.
