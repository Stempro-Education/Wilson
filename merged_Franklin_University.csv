http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	div		a	   Should I do an RN to BSN or an RN to MSN?   
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	p			Whether you earn the B.S. in Nursing (BSN) on the way to your M.S. in Nursing (MSN) depends on your unique situation and ultimate career goals. While the MSN is the necessary credential for teaching or leadership positions, you may need the BSN to obtain your initial nursing position while you work toward the next level. 
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	p			In addition, your employer may have reimbursement programs or career development programs that make earning the BSN more advantageous for you. However, if you know that the MSN is a requirement for your dream job, an RN to MSN program will put you on fast-track to get there quickly and at a lower cost. 
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	div		a	   What is RN to MSN?   
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	p			Designed for registered nurses with associate degrees or nursing diplomas, Franklin’s streamlined RN to MSN is a 12-week bridge course that puts you on the path to earning your M.S. in Nursing (MSN). To be admitted into Franklin’s MSN or MSN-Family Nurse Practitioner programs, you must complete the bridge course with a grade of B or better. 
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	div		a	   When can I start the RN to MSN?   
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	p			The RN to MSN has multiple start dates each year, including summer (May). 
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	div		a	   How much will the RN to BSN bridge course (4 credit hours) cost?   
http://www.franklin.edu/faqs	p			Franklin University offers a quality education at a competitive cost so you can afford to invest in your future. Our per credit hour tuition rates (vs. per year or per term rates) enable you to get a realistic estimate of exactly how much your degree will cost.  Our 2019-2020 tuition rate is $398 per credit hour and the nursing programs also require additional fees for background screening/practicum ($150), as well as clinical course fees ($250 per course for selected courses). Ask our helpful staff about available financing options and financial aid programs.
