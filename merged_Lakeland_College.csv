https://lakeland.edu/coop	h1			Overview
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong		span	Cooperative education is an exciting new way to earn a Lakeland degree, earn valuable professional experience and control the cost of college. Lakeland is the 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	span			only school in the Midwest
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			 fully offering cooperative education.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	p			Consider the benefits of being a Lakeland co-op student:
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li		strong	Apply what you’re learning in the classroom in full-time jobs with our co-op employer partners. You’ll 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			graduate with 12-18 months of professional work experience
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li			, often in your academic major.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li		strong	You’ll 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			earn academic credit for your work
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li			, as well as wages you can put toward the cost of attending Lakeland.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li		strong	Along with the wages you’ll earn, Lakeland’s co-op scholarship covers 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			$14,000 per year
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li			 – that’s $56,000 in scholarship money over four years.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li		strong	The combined scholarship and money you’ll earn from working can total more than $100,000 over four years, which means you can 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			graduate with little or no debt
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li		strong	You’ll be able to 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			graduate in four years
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li		strong	These opportunities 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	strong			work around your schedule
https://lakeland.edu/coop	li			, so feel free to join a sport, the band, the choir, student organizations, get a role in the play or participate in one of our many program-specific organizations.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	p			By incorporating work experiences into an academic experience, you’ll see the link between what you learn in the classroom and the job you’re performing in the workplace. We’ll also teach you the skills employees seek that will help you develop as a professional.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	p			Employer partners from a wide variety of professional work environments and industries are eagerly collaborating with Lakeland to hire well-prepared, highly motivated students.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	p			By participating in co-op, employers are actively developing their future pipeline of talent and directly influencing the education of students entering their professions.
https://lakeland.edu/coop	p		a	Lakeland's, 
https://lakeland.edu/coop	a			award winning
https://lakeland.edu/coop	p			, co-op program is administered by LU’s Career Readiness & Cooperative Education staff, and supervised by a faculty member.
