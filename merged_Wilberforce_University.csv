http://wilberforce.edu/housing	span	span		Please plan accordingly, there are no exceptions. 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong			We welcome you to the Wilberforce University Living and Learning Community!
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Wilberforce University is a residential institution providing a variety of living communities.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Living communities invite students to live in residence halls and engage in learning and living experiences that support our academic mission.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Community-building is facilitated by a staff of residence hall directors, resident assistants, and visitation monitors.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong		br	Living Communities
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Students have options for living and learning at Wilberforce University. Students can live in residences like Henderson Hall and the Living Learning Community (LLC). Or they can choose our temporary off-campus housing (due to current residence hall renovations).
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Students live in suite-style rooms and have access to lobby areas, Internet access, and on-site laundry facilities.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p		em	To request and ensure housing, please submit your 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong			Residence Life Housing Contract 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong			July 1 for the Fall semester, December 15 for the Spring Semester, and May 1 for Summer semester (if applicable). 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Other requests will be accommodated as housing is available.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong			Living in the Residence Halls
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p		a	Living together in a community is a unique opportunity. We recognize students come to Wilberforce with many different experiences and expectations. To create common ground for all student residents, we expect them to embrace and abide by guidelines for living in the residence halls. Students can find the guidelines in the 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	a			Welcome to the Neighborhood Guide
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Students are responsible for their items and living space in university-sponsored housing. We encourage students to purchase renter’s insurance to cover items that may be lost or stolen.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			We also reserve the right to remove students from University-sponsored housing upon the discretion of University staff, violations of the code of conduct, residence hall policies, and/or safety concerns. Students who are removed will be provided with 24-hour notice to vacate the premises and will continue to be charged for housing and any fines they have incurred.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Students must adhere to expectations set forth by the Honor Code and Student Code of Conduct.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong			Choosing to Live Off Campus
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			Wilberforce University is a residential campus. We believe that students are best served when they learn and live together.
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	strong			We require students to live on campus. 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p		em	However, students can request an exemption. Students requesting an exemption from living on campus must meet specific criteria. If a student meets the criteria for off-campus housing, they must submit 
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	a			housing-exemption-information
http://wilberforce.edu/housing	p			 to the Office of Residence Life.
