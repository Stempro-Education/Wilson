https://www.hartsem.edu	div			Professor Scott Thumma Interviewed on Split in Methodist Church
https://www.hartsem.edu	div			"A recent proposal to split the United Methodist Church into two - one side in favor of gay marriage and accepting of gay clergy, the other opposed -- is dividing not only the denomination but individual congregations, Professor Scott Thumma told The Hartford Courant.    With 12 million members around the world, Methodists have found themselves at an impasse over the issue. A proposal that still needs approval at an international meeting in May would split the church into a progressive wing that retains the current name and structure, and a ""traditionalist"" group that would establish a new name and go its own way.    “The last major gathering convinced people that they had irreconcilable differences, and what they thought was just a line really was a much, much larger gap,” Professor Thumma told The Courant. “There was no way that they were going to be able to come to some agreement without some sort of split.”    Professor Thumma said the greatest difficulty may rest with local congregations where some would like to follow the progressive stance and others the traditional one.    “In some sense, while this separation plan lays out a way to move forward, it also ends up leaving the really tough decision within congregations, for them to fight it out themselves.”    Read the full article here: Proposal to split United Methodist Church over gay marriage may hit hardest at local level"

https://www.hartsem.edu	div			"The Family and Youth Institute -- a Michigan-based organization that promotes positive youth development, healthy marriages, effective parenting, and mental health and well being -- has just released two resources for Black Muslim youth.    Sarrah AbuLughod, MA '17, Senior Communications Manager for the institute, told Hartford Seminary that these publications are the culmination of a long project.    One is the Uplifting Black Muslim Youth toolkit. According to Sarrah, ""While the resource centers Black Muslim experiences and needs, we also included a section specifically for non-Black Muslims who are sincerely looking for tools and guidance to help increase their understanding of intra-faith racism, systematic injustices and implicit bias (among many other topics) in order to support Black Muslim youth.""    The second is the Uplifting Black Muslim Youth book, which can be downloaded for free. ""Centering the voices of Black Muslim youth, this book summarizes the latest research and is a road map for individuals and institutions invested in transforming feelings and experiences of marginalization, to those of strength and resiliency,"" Sarrah said.    Congrats to Sarrah on helping to develop and promote these important resources!               "

https://www.hartsem.edu	div			"Christianity Today recently published a comprehensive look at the 2020 U.S. Religion Census, interviewing Professor Scott Thumma about his work in identifying the nondenominational faith communities across the country.    Calling this an ""impossible task,"" Professor Thumma said his team of researchers have counted 35,496 independent congregations, though he is certain that is an undercount.  “The denominational reality is getting significantly harder to make sense of,” Professor Thumma told Christianity Today. “With fuzzy identities, and quasi-nondenominational churches, and churches dropping the denominational name. ... It was always difficult. Incredibly difficult. But it’s gotten more difficult. The U.S. Religion Census is the best thing we have, and I’m a strong proponent of it.”  The article, U.S. Religion Census Maps Changing Churches, Declining Denominations, can be found at this link.

https://www.hartsem.edu	div			Professor Lucinda Mosher Has New 'Building Bridges' Book
https://www.hartsem.edu	div			"Lucinda Mosher, Faculty Associate in Interfaith Studies, has announced the release of Power: Divine and Human: Christian and Muslim Perspectives, the latest in the Building Bridges Seminar series.    This is also the seventh book Professor Mosher has co-edited with the Rev. Dr. David Marshall, programme executive in interreligious dialogue and co-operation at the World Council of Churches in Geneva. The books are based on the proceedings of the Building Bridges Seminar's 16th convening, which took place in Washington, DC, and Warrenton, VA, in May 2017.    The book, from Georgetown University Press, can be found at this link.    ""This volume of the Building Bridges Seminar, Power: Divine and Human, Christian and Muslim Perspectives, comprises pairs of essays by Christians and Muslims which introduce texts for dialogical study, plus the actual text-excerpts themselves.    ""This new book goes far beyond mere reporting on a dialogical seminar; rather, it provides guidance and materials for constructing a similar dialogical experience on a particular topic. As a resource for comparative theology, Power: Divine and Human is unique in that it takes up a topic not usually explored in depth in Christian-Muslim conversations. It is written by scholars for scholars. However, in tone and structure, it is suitable for the non-specialist as well. Students (undergraduate and graduate), religious leaders, and motivated non-specialists will find it readable and useful. While it falls solidly in the domain of comparative theology, it can also be used in courses on dialogical reading of scripture, interreligious relations, and political philosophy.""    Congratulations, Lucinda!"

https://www.hartsem.edu	div			President Joel N. Lohr Joins Government Officials, Faith Leaders in Condemning Antisemitism
https://www.hartsem.edu	div			“What kind of world do we live in if our places of prayer—especially synagogues and mosques—are the ones that need the most security?”    President Joel N. Lohr posed this question to the hundreds gathered on Monday, Dec. 30, in the sanctuary of West Hartford’s Beth El Temple as the synagogue hosted “A Community Rally against Hate: Standing Together against Antisemitism.”    He was among a dozen speakers, including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, who condemned the attacks at a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, N.J., on Saturday night, as well as a string of other attacks in New York City and the New Jersey Kosher Market shootings on Dec. 10. Visitors to the synagogue were greeted with a heavy police presence and bags were searched, but the atmosphere was one of community determination to counter the attacks with interfaith unity and understanding.    President Lohr’s message emphasized that “as Christians we have a special duty to stand with the Jewish people and fight antisemitism. Our history is almost entirely wrapped up in what religious scholars call supersessionism—think ‘replacement theology’—of the Jewish people. … few lay Christians today seem to understand that was happened in Nazi Germany is in fact part of our Christian history, something that is intrinsically linked to our own story as Christians.”    Understanding this link is key to stemming the tide of killing and hatred against Jews, he said.    “To my dear Jewish friends and the larger Jewish community here today, I offer these words. As the President of Hartford Seminary, and personally as a Christian, I commit to doing everything in my power to stand with you to fight antisemitism and to use education to bring peace and hope to our fractured families, and world. I cannot undo the past. But I can try to influence the future. Please pray for me, as I pray for you.”    David Waren, President and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford, made a statement at the rally’s opening that echoed throughout the evening.    “The measure of a community is not whether biased incidents occur,” he said. “The measure of a community is how that community responds. Standing with these leaders … there is no question that we have the capacity and the will to confront and overcome this resurgent virus of hate with unabashed pride, unabashed confidence, and with utter determination.    Several government officials who spoke at the rally mentioned additional federal and state funds that have been or could be appropriated to help places of worship add security. But State Sen. Saud Anwar, a Hartford Seminary corporator and Muslim community leader, said we should not accept these attacks on any faith community as “the new normal.”    “The status quo is unacceptable and should be unacceptable to each and every one of us,” he said. “We will not let someone else define how we pray and how we celebrate. We are one family. We will stand united.”    Additional coverage of the event can be found at these link:    We-ha.com    The Hartford Courant

https://www.hartsem.edu	div			If Beliefs Divide Us and Values Unite Us ... Does God Matter?
https://www.hartsem.edu	div			"Please join Hartford Seminary, Chai Mitzvah, and First Church, West Hartford, for a lively discussion moderated by Colin McEnroe, host of WNPR's ""The Colin McEnroe Show.""    Scott A. Shay's recent book In Good Faith: Questioning Religion and Atheism makes a cogent argument for the rational belief in God. He defends monotheism against those who claim that religion has done more to divide us than unite us. Tom Krattenmaker, author of Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, argues from a secular humanist perspective that we can all agree on values to live by and focus on making this world a better place without a concept of an overarching deity. Colin McEnroe, himself on a much-discussed spiritual journey, will engage Scott, Krattenmaker, and the audience in a lively discussion. We expect this to be a sold out evening.    Tickets are $10 in advance; $15 at the door. Hartford Seminary students and faculty are free but must register. To purchase for a group of more than 5, please contact Susan Schoenberger at sschoenberger@hartsem.edu or 860-509-9519.    Note: Hartford Seminary is committed to providing accessibility for all. Please contact Susan Schoenberger at sschoenberger@hartsem.edu or 860-509-9519 at least 3 days in advance if you have questions about our accessibility or need reasonable accommodations for this event.

He co-founded Signature Bank of New York and has served as its Chairman since its formation.

Shay called for the re-imposition of Glass-Steagall and breaking up the big banks at a TEDx talk at the NY Stock Exchange in 2012. Throughout his life, he has been a student of religion and how religion ought to apply to the world outside of the synagogue, church, or mosque. In addition to authoring articles relating to the Jewish community, Scott authored the best-selling Getting Our Groove Back: How to Energize American Jewry.    Tom Krattenmaker is a writer specializing in religion in public life and author of Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, honored as one of the top two religion books of the year by the Religion News Association. His first book, Onward Christian Athletes, examined Christianity in professional sports.

Krattenmaker writes regularly for USA Today’s op-ed page as a member of the newspaper’s editorial Board of Contributors. His work has also appeared in recent years in the Washington Post, Religion News Service, and Huffington Post, among numerous other media outlets.

The book ""examines the life and work of Eli Smith, William McClure Thomson, and Edward Robinson and their descriptions of the 'Bible Lands.' While there has been a great deal written about American travelogues to the Holy Lands, this book focuses on how these three prominent American Protestants described the indigenous peoples, and how those images were consumed by American Christians who had little direct experience with the 'Bible Lands.'""

http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	p			BOOK SUMMARY
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	em			The  Other 80 Percent: Turning Your Church's Spectators into Active Participants 
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	p			argues    for seeing the marginally involved members of a church as a mission    field.  The book is a mix of original analysis of national  research on   attenders, many field studies and hundreds of interviews as well    as reflections on cultural shifts related to volunteering and observed    patterns from our studies of church leadership teams.  It offers a    diversity of approaches for dealing with this 20/80 problem (20% of the   people  do 80% of the work while most of the rest do nothing) and   various strategies by  which a church's leadership might begin to   address the issues of member  mobilization and discipleship.  
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	p			The premise is that very  few church leaders engage a   large percentage of their membership  in a life of faith that includes   regular involvement in the congregation.   Thus, part of the reason for   writing this book was to confront this too-often  taken for granted   reality that it is acceptable for a church to function with  only a half   of the members ever in attendance and only a quarter of those  members   significantly involving giving, serving, fellowshipping, attending, or    inviting others.  
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	p			We offer a number of possible ways to  lead a   congregation past the 20/80 malaise.  We suggest that leadership  teams   need to think critically evaluate what they are currently doing as a    church to facilitate involvement.  We further implore clergy, in    desperate times like these for the future of the church, to think    creatively and outside the usual approaches to reach the less involved.     We suggest that there is no single solution, no one-size-fits-all   answer, to  this problem.  But we do offer a number of possible   approaches to addressing  this issue from which they could pick and   choose the most fitting for their context. So while we rely on  surveys, field studies and   interviews to arrive at our description of the issue  and possible   solutions, as a whole the book this essentially an action handbook   to   changing member involvement dynamics.
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	p			We suggest that a  church should begin to  correct its  waning involvement and participation ratio by: 
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	li			First, taking an assessment of  the opinions of members – listen to them (the highly involved and the least  engaged) what motivated and hinders commitment in your congregation.
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	li			Second, learn the patterns of  involvement as well as the roadblocks and challenges in your community, in your  church programs, and in the expectations of your staff and lay leaders. 
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	li			Third, identify those  activities you are doing currently which promote and attract robust involvement  and intentionally strengthen these to a greater degree.
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	li			Fourth, think outside the box  of ways of being the church, connecting members in ministry that fits their  everyday lives and lifestyles, and that meets their needs, the church’s needs  and the mandates of the gospel. 
http://hirr.hartsem.edu/theother80percent.htm	li			Finally, remember that  involvement and participation are the correlates of spiritual growth and a  person’s spiritual fulfillment.  80%  participation isn’t the goal – spiritual fervor and growth is.

http://www.hartsem.edu	div			Professor Scott Thumma Interviewed on Split in Methodist Church
http://www.hartsem.edu	div			"A recent proposal to split the United Methodist Church into two - one side in favor of gay marriage and accepting of gay clergy, the other opposed -- is dividing not only the denomination but individual congregations, Professor Scott Thumma told The Hartford Courant.    With 12 million members around the world, Methodists have found themselves at an impasse over the issue. A proposal that still needs approval at an international meeting in May would split the church into a progressive wing that retains the current name and structure, and a ""traditionalist"" group that would establish a new name and go its own way.    “The last major gathering convinced people that they had irreconcilable differences, and what they thought was just a line really was a much, much larger gap,” Professor Thumma told The Courant. “There was no way that they were going to be able to come to some agreement without some sort of split.”    Professor Thumma said the greatest difficulty may rest with local congregations where some would like to follow the progressive stance and others the traditional one.    “In some sense, while this separation plan lays out a way to move forward, it also ends up leaving the really tough decision within congregations, for them to fight it out themselves.”    Read the full article here: Proposal to split United Methodist Church over gay marriage may hit hardest at local level"

http://www.hartsem.edu	div			"The Family and Youth Institute -- a Michigan-based organization that promotes positive youth development, healthy marriages, effective parenting, and mental health and well being -- has just released two resources for Black Muslim youth.    Sarrah AbuLughod, MA '17, Senior Communications Manager for the institute, told Hartford Seminary that these publications are the culmination of a long project.    One is the Uplifting Black Muslim Youth toolkit. According to Sarrah, ""While the resource centers Black Muslim experiences and needs, we also included a section specifically for non-Black Muslims who are sincerely looking for tools and guidance to help increase their understanding of intra-faith racism, systematic injustices and implicit bias (among many other topics) in order to support Black Muslim youth.""    The second is the Uplifting Black Muslim Youth book, which can be downloaded for free. ""Centering the voices of Black Muslim youth, this book summarizes the latest research and is a road map for individuals and institutions invested in transforming feelings and experiences of marginalization, to those of strength and resiliency,"" Sarrah said.    Congrats to Sarrah on helping to develop and promote these important resources!               "

As a resource for comparative theology, Power: Divine and Human is unique in that it takes up a topic not usually explored in depth in Christian-Muslim conversations. It is written by scholars for scholars. However, in tone and structure, it is suitable for the non-specialist as well. Students (undergraduate and graduate), religious leaders, and motivated non-specialists will find it readable and useful. While it falls solidly in the domain of comparative theology, it can also be used in courses on dialogical reading of scripture, interreligious relations, and political philosophy.""    Congratulations, Lucinda!"

http://www.hartsem.edu	div			President Joel N. Lohr Joins Government Officials, Faith Leaders in Condemning Antisemitism
http://www.hartsem.edu	div			“What kind of world do we live in if our places of prayer—especially synagogues and mosques—are the ones that need the most security?”    President Joel N. Lohr posed this question to the hundreds gathered on Monday, Dec. 30, in the sanctuary of West Hartford’s Beth El Temple as the synagogue hosted “A Community Rally against Hate: Standing Together against Antisemitism.”    He was among a dozen speakers, including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, who condemned the attacks at a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, N.J., on Saturday night, as well as a string of other attacks in New York City and the New Jersey Kosher Market shootings on Dec. 10. Visitors to the synagogue were greeted with a heavy police presence and bags were searched, but the atmosphere was one of community determination to counter the attacks with interfaith unity and understanding.    President Lohr’s message emphasized that “as Christians we have a special duty to stand with the Jewish people and fight antisemitism. Our history is almost entirely wrapped up in what religious scholars call supersessionism—think ‘replacement theology’—of the Jewish people. … few lay Christians today seem to understand that was happened in Nazi Germany is in fact part of our Christian history, something that is intrinsically linked to our own story as Christians.”    Understanding this link is key to stemming the tide of killing and hatred against Jews, he said.    “To my dear Jewish friends and the larger Jewish community here today, I offer these words. As the President of Hartford Seminary, and personally as a Christian, I commit to doing everything in my power to stand with you to fight antisemitism and to use education to bring peace and hope to our fractured families, and world. I cannot undo the past. But I can try to influence the future. Please pray for me, as I pray for you.”    David Waren, President and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford, made a statement at the rally’s opening that echoed throughout the evening.    “The measure of a community is not whether biased incidents occur,” he said. “The measure of a community is how that community responds. Standing with these leaders … there is no question that we have the capacity and the will to confront and overcome this resurgent virus of hate with unabashed pride, unabashed confidence, and with utter determination.    Several government officials who spoke at the rally mentioned additional federal and state funds that have been or could be appropriated to help places of worship add security. But State Sen. Saud Anwar, a Hartford Seminary corporator and Muslim community leader, said we should not accept these attacks on any faith community as “the new normal.”    “The status quo is unacceptable and should be unacceptable to each and every one of us,” he said. “We will not let someone else define how we pray and how we celebrate. We are one family. We will stand united.”    Additional coverage of the event can be found at these link:    We-ha.com    The Hartford Courant

http://www.hartsem.edu	div			Join us to hear from Dr. Bruce B. Lawrence, Professor of Islamic Studies Emeritus at Duke University and adjunct Professor at Alliance of Civilizations Institute, Ibn Haldun University, Istanbul.    Allah merits more than faithful acceptance or hostile rejection. Neither theological nor ideological, advancing neither apologetic nor polemical agendas, Dr. Lawrence approaches the name/the subject of Allah as a perspectivist.    A perspective exploration must be at once fair minded, openended and expansive. Dr. Lawrence will examine literary and historical sources, including Jack Miles, God in the Qur’an (2018) as well as his own most recent books, Who is Allah? (2015) and The Koran in English: A Biography (2017), but he will also foreground the contribution of visual artists, such as M.F. Husain, Arahmaiani and Sandow Birk.      About the Speaker  Bruce B. Lawrence is Professor of Islamic Studies Emeritus at Duke University and adjunct Professor at Alliance of Civilizations Institute, Ibn Haldun University, Istanbul.  His research interests include: Contemporary Islam as Religious Ideology; South Asian Sufism; Islamicate Cosmopolitanism; the Multiple Roles and Uses of the Qur’an. Among his monographs are: The Koran in English - A Biography (Princeton University Press, 2017), Who is Allah? (University of North Carolina Press, 2015), The Qur’an – a Biography (Grove/Atlantic, 2006);  and Sufi Martyrs of Love (with Carl Ernst; Palgrave Macmillan, 2002). He is also working with Professor Rafey Habib on a multi-year project, The Qur’an – A Verse Translation, forthcoming from WW Norton in 2021.

http://www.hartsem.edu	div			If Beliefs Divide Us and Values Unite Us ... Does God Matter?
http://www.hartsem.edu	div			"Please join Hartford Seminary, Chai Mitzvah, and First Church, West Hartford, for a lively discussion moderated by Colin McEnroe, host of WNPR's ""The Colin McEnroe Show.""    Scott A. Shay's recent book In Good Faith: Questioning Religion and Atheism makes a cogent argument for the rational belief in God. He defends monotheism against those who claim that religion has done more to divide us than unite us. Tom Krattenmaker, author of Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, argues from a secular humanist perspective that we can all agree on values to live by and focus on making this world a better place without a concept of an overarching deity. Colin McEnroe, himself on a much-discussed spiritual journey, will engage Scott, Krattenmaker, and the audience in a lively discussion. We expect this to be a sold out evening.    Tickets are $10 in advance; $15 at the door. Hartford Seminary students and faculty are free but must register. To purchase for a group of more than 5, please contact Susan Schoenberger at sschoenberger@hartsem.edu or 860-509-9519.    Note: Hartford Seminary is committed to providing accessibility for all. Please contact Susan Schoenberger at sschoenberger@hartsem.edu or 860-509-9519 at least 3 days in advance if you have questions about our accessibility or need reasonable accommodations for this event.                About the Speakers  Scott A. Shay, author of In Good Faith: Questioning Religion and Atheism, has had a successful business career spanning Wall Street, private equity, venture capital, and banking. He co-founded Signature Bank of New York and has served as its Chairman since its formation. He has been a provocative commentator on many financial issues, including among others, how the banking system should best function to help society, the implications of a cashless world, and tax reform. Shay called for the re-imposition of Glass-Steagall and breaking up the big banks at a TEDx talk at the NY Stock Exchange in 2012. Throughout his life, he has been a student of religion and how religion ought to apply to the world outside of the synagogue, church, or mosque. In addition to authoring articles relating to the Jewish community, Scott authored the best-selling Getting Our Groove Back: How to Energize American Jewry.    Tom Krattenmaker is a writer specializing in religion in public life and author of Confessions of a Secular Jesus Follower, honored as one of the top two religion books of the year by the Religion News Association. His first book, Onward Christian Athletes, examined Christianity in professional sports. Krattenmaker’s second book, The Evangelicals You Don’t Know, on the “new evangelicals” in post-Christian America, was a winner in the best books competition of the Religion Newswriters Association in 2014. Krattenmaker writes regularly for USA Today’s op-ed page as a member of the newspaper’s editorial Board of Contributors. His work has also appeared in recent years in the Washington Post, Religion News Service, and Huffington Post, among numerous other media outlets.  About the Moderator  Colin McEnroe is an author, playwright, professor, columnist, and blogger, who is allergic to penicillin and enjoys photographing his dog wearing hats and publishing those photos to the internet.

Grafton's new book, An American Biblical Orientalism: The Construction of Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Nineteenth-Century American Evangelical Piety.    The book ""examines the life and work of Eli Smith, William McClure Thomson, and Edward Robinson and their descriptions of the 'Bible Lands.' While there has been a great deal written about American travelogues to the Holy Lands, this book focuses on how these three prominent American Protestants described the indigenous peoples, and how those images were consumed by American Christians who had little direct experience with the 'Bible Lands.'""
