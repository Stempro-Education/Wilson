http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	h2			                   Boundaries are boring.*                 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p			                   Most of the students at Marlboro are interested in lots of things, and those don’t always fit into one box with a single name like “psychology.”                 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		strong	                   So instead of locking yourself into a single major track, 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	strong			at Marlboro you can study exactly what you’re interested in
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p			. Maybe that combines psychology and mathematics. Or zoology and creative writing. Or ethnography and dance.                 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	strong			Unconventional approach
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	                   You’ll start by 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			exploring courses
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	 across 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			the curriculum
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	. By the end of the first three semesters, the only requirement we expect of you is the proven ability to 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			write clearly and effectively
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	                   In years three and four, the focus turns to self-directed learning and deep partnerships with faculty. You’ll have the opportunity to create intensive classes called 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			tutorials
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	 and do independent research. It all builds toward a major project: the 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			Plan of Concentration
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	                   By graduation, you will have mastered the art of writing well, learned to collaborate with others, and led an ambitious project from idea to reality. These skills are critical to success in any field, and we guarantee you’ll graduate with them. We call that 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			the Marlboro Promise
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	strong			Learn as much outside the classroom as in it
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	                   Most students get off campus at least once during their time here. That could be formally through 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			study abroad
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	, a 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			semester exchange
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	 with another college, or through a six-to-eight month international internship as part of our 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			World Studies Program
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p			. It could also mean grant-funded independent research locally or globally.                 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	                   Opportunities for 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			internships, volunteer positions, and jobs
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p			 in your field of interest will contribute to your education as well as build your resumé.                 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	strong			Innovative graduate programs
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			Graduate school
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p			 at Marlboro combines the academic intensity of the undergraduate curriculum with professional skills and practical experience. Small groups work together and learn from local leaders in business, nonprofits, education, and advocacy.                 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	                   Marlboro undergrads have the chance to enter the graduate school through our 
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	a			Accelerated Master’s Track
http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p		a	, while working professionals can sample the curriculum in

http://www.marlboro.edu/academics	p			                   * Unless you’re studying the boundaries themselves, of course. Why do they exist? Who put them there? Marlboro students might not respect boundaries, but we pay close attention to intersections.
