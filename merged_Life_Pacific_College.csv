http://lifepacific.edu/arts	p			Since 1923, musicians and artists have earned their education through Life Pacific University, finding creative ways to communicate the message of the gospel with a relevance that is unique to their culture. Today Life alumni are advancing the kingdom of God throughout the United States and around the globe in a wide range of careers ranging from the professional music industry to the artistic mission field. Graduates are integrating and utilizing their education and training to impact the communities in which they live and the churches in which they serve.
http://lifepacific.edu/arts	p			The Life Pacific Worship Arts Department provides a wide variety of opportunities for students of all majors to explore the arts through LPU Arts.  These programs and opportunities allow creatives of all types to hone their skills in order to better use them in the field to which they are called.  The LPU Arts team works to allow students to explore their God given creativity while gaining exposure to music, art, and theater through field trips each semester. Our metropolitan location, with its proximity to art galleries, concert halls, museums, and major academic institutions, makes the San Dimas campus an ideal place to cultivate art education.
