Boston College strongly encourages students to apply to their first choice undergraduate division, as this can be challenging to change later in the undergraduate process.

We accept the ACT (College Code: 1788) or SAT (CEEB Code: 3083) and we do not require any Optional Writing portion. If you submit multiple scores, we will superscore the tests for our evaluation.
http://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/apply.html	li			Official standardized test results must be sent directly from the testing agency to Boston College. If having score reports sent from the College Board or ACT to Boston College presents a financial hardship, applicants should have their high school guidance counselor contact the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Alternatives may be explored on a case-by-case basis. 
http://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/apply.html	li		a	SAT subject tests are not required. You are welcome to submit SAT Subject Tests for consideration with your application.

Our most competitive applicants tend to have a high school program with four years of the five main subjects: English, Math, Social Science, Natural Science, and Foreign Language.

http://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/apply.html	p		br	 - You are required to submit two teacher evaluations as part of your application to Boston College.

Your application fee should be submitted with your Common Application. Given the volume of applications Boston College receives, we strongly recommend that you submit the application fee online. If you are unable to submit the fee online, you should mail a check or money order.
http://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/apply.html	p			*Fee Waiver Request
http://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/admission/apply.html	p			If submitting the $80 application fee presents a financial hardship for your family and you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you may apply for an application fee waiver. You may apply for a fee waiver through the Common Application.
