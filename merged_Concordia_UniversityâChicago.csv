https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	span			What is the Tuition Assistance Refund Policy when withdrawing from classes?
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	strong			Military Tuition Assistance Refund Policy
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	p			In accordance with the regulation requirement from the Department of Defense, Tuition Assistance must be calculated to determine eligibility when a service member has withdrawn from their course(s). The full amount of Tuition Assistance that a student receives is based on the completion of their course(s). Students will be considered to have earned all of their Tuition Assistance after the completion of 60 percent of the payment period. If a student officially or unofficially withdraws from the semester on or before the 60 percent of the payment period and received Tuition Assistance, Concordia University Chicago (CUC) is required to review eligibility for the amount received.
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	p			In order to determine the amount of Tuition Assistance earned up to the time of withdrawal, CUC determines the percentage of the payment period the student attended. In addition, the unearned amount of aid is also determined by the percentage of the payment period the student attended. The student may have officially withdrawn from their course(s) or, in the case of an unofficial withdrawal, CUC will use the last date the student was involved in an academically related activity.
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	p			The following formula will be used to calculate the unearned portion amount of Tuition Assistance:
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	p			For example, if a student completes 30% of the course(s), 70% will be the unearned portion that must be returned to the government.
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	p		a	Any unearned Tuition Assistance that was applied to the student account must be returned within 45 days of the date the school determined the student withdrew. The unearned portion will be returned directly to the government. Any remaining balance on the service member’s account would be their responsibility and should contact Student Business Services at 
https://cuchicago.edu/veterans	a			Student.Accounts@CUChicago.edu

After taking classes and interacting with my instructors and and classmates, I learned that there was a great deal more to know about the field. I have been working and interacting with various colleagues at other universities  and I am confident when I speak to them and have been able to inform them with regards to theories practices and policies thanks to Concordia University Chicago”
