https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	h2			Pilot Pulse Survey Results
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	time			October 31, 2019
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			Dear Members of the Harvard Community,
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p		a	Earlier this year we sent the 10-question Pilot Pulse Survey on Inclusion and Belonging to all students, faculty, academic personnel, and staff at Harvard. We asked whether you felt that you belong and have the opportunity and support to succeed at the University. Thank you to those of you who took the time to complete the survey. Today, I share the 
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	a			results
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			, which I believe will contribute to creating a Harvard where every member of our community can thrive and excel.
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			This pilot survey was one of several recommendations from the Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging. We heard from more than 20,000 individuals—close to half of our community. Overall, the survey gives us some reason for optimism: 77 percent of you said you feel that you belong. However, that means that 23 percent of our community did not agree with the statement, “I feel I belong at Harvard.” Clearly, while we are working hard, there is still room for much improvement. We need to continue to work as a community towards positive change.
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			Each of you—whether you are here to learn, to teach, to work, or some combination of these activities—should feel that you belong here and that we are a better Harvard because you are a member of this community. The diversity of people, experiences, and ideas at Harvard enriches all our lives.
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p		a	The results of the Pilot Pulse Survey are already informing the work led by Senior Advisor John Wilson and the team in the 
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	a			Office for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			. John has convened a new Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Leadership Council composed of representatives from every School and many of the units across the University. Through sharing best practices and other efforts, the Council will support the good work already taking place across Harvard. Additionally, we have launched a search for a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer who will help lead our efforts.
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			As we are reminded by events that have occurred at Harvard, as well as those routinely reported in the broader media around the country, we still live in a world where many members of our community are made to feel marginalized. This first Pulse Survey was a very useful pilot, and we have gleaned important insights to refine this tool. I look forward to working with all of you to build upon what we have learned so that we can create an environment in which all members of our community may thrive. Let us begin this important work together.
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p		br	All the best,
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p			 Larry
https://harvard.edu/president/news/2019/pilot-pulse-survey-results	p		em	P.S. You can learn more about the survey, recommendations, and how the University is already acting on those recommendations in the
