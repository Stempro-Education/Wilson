http://cooper.edu	p			Founded by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper in 1859, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art offers education in art, architecture and engineering, as well as courses in the humanities and social sciences.
http://cooper.edu	p		a	“My feelings, my desires, my hopes, embrace humanity throughout the world,” Peter Cooper proclaimed in a speech in 1853. He looked forward to a time when, 
http://cooper.edu	a			“knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”
http://cooper.edu	p		a	From its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to 
http://cooper.edu	a			civic virtue and harmony
http://cooper.edu	p		a	Peter Cooper wanted his graduates to acquire the technical mastery and entrepreneurial skills, enrich their intellects and spark their creativity, and develop 
http://cooper.edu	a			a sense of social justice that would translate into action

http://cooper.edu/admissions	div			Architecture. Art. Engineering. NYC.
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			The Cooper Union is where creative people from all backgrounds come to ask critical questions to advance the public good. 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			Learning at Cooper will take you beyond the classroom, lab, or studio. You’ll be encouraged to collaborate and experiment, and to engage with the flux of ideas and movements that make New York City a vital cultural center. 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span		a	Three renowned professional schools specializing in 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			architecture
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			art
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span		a	, and 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			engineering
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span		a	 offer rigorous courses of study, while a shared core curriculum in the 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			humanities and social sciences
http://cooper.edu/admissions	span			 provides the historical and theoretical foundation for discovering your creative potential and applying it in pursuit of a just and sustainable society.
http://cooper.edu/admissions	p			Founded by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper in 1859, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art offers education in art, architecture and engineering, as well as courses in the humanities and social sciences.
http://cooper.edu/admissions	p		a	“My feelings, my desires, my hopes, embrace humanity throughout the world,” Peter Cooper proclaimed in a speech in 1853. He looked forward to a time when, 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	a			“knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”
http://cooper.edu/admissions	p		a	From its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	a			civic virtue and harmony
http://cooper.edu/admissions	p		a	Peter Cooper wanted his graduates to acquire the technical mastery and entrepreneurial skills, enrich their intellects and spark their creativity, and develop 
http://cooper.edu/admissions	a			a sense of social justice that would translate into action

http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	p			Founded by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper in 1859, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art offers education in art, architecture and engineering, as well as courses in the humanities and social sciences.
http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	p		a	“My feelings, my desires, my hopes, embrace humanity throughout the world,” Peter Cooper proclaimed in a speech in 1853. He looked forward to a time when, 
http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	a			“knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”
http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	p		a	From its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to 
http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	a			civic virtue and harmony
http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	p		a	Peter Cooper wanted his graduates to acquire the technical mastery and entrepreneurial skills, enrich their intellects and spark their creativity, and develop 
http://cooper.edu/admissions/applying-to-cu	a			a sense of social justice that would translate into action

http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	h4			The Foundation Building
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	p			The Cooper Union’s Foundation Building, completed in 1858, was bestowed as a gift to New York City and became testament to Peter Cooper’s philanthropy and ingenuity. The Foundation Building was once the tallest building in Manhattan and the most innovative addition to the city’s landscape. Designed with a rolled iron I-beam infrastructure, it also included an interior shaft that preceded the common use of elevators. The Foundation Building is also a prominent cultural and intellectual destination for its auditorium, The Great Hall. This space has hosted speeches and events for several United States presidents and esteemed public figures that have had a profound impact throughout American history. Today, it is a National Historic Landmark and designated New York City Landmark, and it provides space for classrooms, studios, the main library and the Arthur A. Houghton, Jr. Gallery. The interior was renovated in the 1970s by John Hedjuk, former Dean of Cooper Union's Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture, and in 2002 an exterior restoration and rededication was completed.
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	h4			The Great Hall
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	p		sup	Peter Cooper believed that public engagement was essential to a thriving democracy and designed a space within the Foundation Building as a forum to do so: the Great Hall. This was created to bring America’s most influential pioneers of the 19
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	p			 century to the citizens of New York City. One of the most famous guests was Abraham Lincoln in February 1860 where he delivered his “Right Makes Might” speech. The Great Hall also hosted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, women’s suﬀrage champions Susan B. Anthony and Victoria Woodhull, Samuel Gompers, and the earliest workers’ rights campaign movements. It was also the birthplace of the American Red Cross and the NAACP.
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	p			For 160 years, the Great Hall has remained a prominent venue hosting United States presidents including Ulysses S. Grant, William Howard Taft, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Other presenters have included authors such as Harriet Beecher Stowe and Salmon Rushdie, intellectuals including Bertrand Russell and Susan Sontag, scientists such as Thomas Huxley and Brian Greene, and even popular musicians including Benny Carter and Billy Joel.
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	h4			41 Cooper Square
http://cooper.edu/admissions/facts	p			The Cooper Union’s most recent campus addition, a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified New Academic Building (NAB), is 41 Cooper Square, the school’s premiere academic facility. Designed by 2005 Pritzker Prize-winning architect Thom Mayne of Morphosis, the building officially opened in September 2009. The 9-story, 175,000 square foot, full-block building replaced more than 40 percent of the academic space at the college with reconfigurable state-of-the-art classrooms, laboratories, studios and public spaces. The building is also one of the most advanced for its exceptional use of green technologies.
