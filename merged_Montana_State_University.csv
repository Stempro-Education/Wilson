http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	p		strong	MSU Sustained Dialogue is recruiting MSU students for a 
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	strong			WEEKLY, semester-long
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	p		strong	 dialogue-to-action process regarding political affiliation, polarization, campus-climate, and building relationships across lines of differences moving into the upcoming 2020 election. 
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	strong			MSU students from all political affiliations (or lack thereof) are encouraged to apply.
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	p			 Groups will meet weekly to share thoughts, feelings, and experiences relating to political affiliation and climate to better understand tensions and how to collaboratively build solutions and initiatives to foster a productive political climate on campus. 
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	strong			**** Although this event is labeled as a one time event, participants will be committed to attending WEEKLY dialogues on Wednesdays at 6PM. 
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	strong			WHAT IS SUSTAINED DIALOGUE?
http://calendar.msu.montana.edu/events/32081	p	p		"""Dialogue is a process of genuine interaction through which human beings listen to each other deeply enough to be changed by what they learn. Each makes a serious effort to take other's concerns into their own picture, even when disagreement persists. No participant gives up their identity, but each recognizes enough of the other's valid human claims that they will act differently toward the other."" "
