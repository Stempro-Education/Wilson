As you decide on which college or university is right for you, there are few considerations more important than a campus visit. For many Lakers, that’s the time they know they’ve found their place, the moment they know they’re home

http://www.mercyhurst.edu/visit	h3			Find Us on the Road
http://www.mercyhurst.edu/visit	p	h3		If you can't make one of our on-campus events, we might be coming to you! Our admissions counselors travel throughout the year, visiting high schools, college fairs, and other admissions and recruitment events.

http://www.mercyhurst.edu/visit	h3			Our Campus
http://www.mercyhurst.edu/visit	p	h3		The only thing that does our campus justice is our campus. From Mercyhurst’s beginning in 1926, founder Mother Borgia Egan sought to establish our campus as the “beauty spot in the diocese of Erie.” The English Gothic elements of Old Main, designed by prominent Philadelphia architect F. Ferdinand Durang, are carried throughout our academic buildings, athletic facilities and student residences, effecting an ideal setting for university life. As you walk under the Gothic arches and across the open greens and brick courtyards, you’ll find places on campus for everything from quiet study to a pickup game of Frisbee with friends.
