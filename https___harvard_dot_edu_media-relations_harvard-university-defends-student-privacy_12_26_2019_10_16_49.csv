https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span			Harvard University Defends Student Privacy
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span			CAMBRIDGE, MA – Calling the summary judgment filing of an anti-race conscious admissions group a “a 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		concerted public relations effort” that relies on “distortions” and “misleading characterizations,” lawyers
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		 for Harvard University today filed in U.S. District Court a robust defense of student privacy, drawing a firm line to protect applicants and the university’s admissions practices.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		The Harvard filing, in 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		response to Students for Fair Admissions’ (SFFA) attempt to make public information protected by law, argues the SFFA filing was “orchestrated by an opponent of racial diversity who seeks above all to end the consideration of race in college admissions,” and that it reflects SFFA’s inability “to find any actual documentary or testimonial support for the purported scheme of intentional discrimination alleged by the Complaint.”
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		Harvard seeks to protect a narrow category of documents in the interest of student privacy and the integrity of Harvard’s admissions process.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		“Harvard, like every college and university across this country, has an
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		 obligation to protect student and applicant privacy. Harvard is deeply committed to protecting the extensive personal information applicants entrust to us in the admissions process, and today’s filing underscores this effort,” said Anna Cowenhoven, a spokesperson for the University. 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		The filing argues that disclosure of proprietary information about Harvard’s admissions process would seriously impair that process by emboldening paid college consultants—a $400 million industry—to advise applicants on how to conform their conduct and their applications to Harvard’s perceived criteria. This would disadvantage low-income applicants who can’t afford the consultants and directly impair Harvard’s ability to recruit and admit a diverse class each year.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/harvard-university-defends-student-privacy	span	span		“There is no evidence in SFFA’s motion for summary judgment, nor in the nearly 100,000 pages of documents that Harvard produced, nor the 20 depositions of Harvard witnesses, to support SFFA’s allegations that Harvard maintains racial quotas or has engaged in a deliberate effort to suppress Asian-American admissions,” said Cowenhoven. “In fact, a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the data and evidence makes clear that Harvard College does not discriminate against applicants from any group, including Asian-Americans, whose share of the admitted class has grown by nearly 30% since 2010.”
