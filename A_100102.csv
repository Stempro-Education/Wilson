https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply/deadlines	strong			Early Admission
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply/deadlines	p			: Austin College accepts applications from qualified students who seek Early Admission. Normally, these students will be classified as second-semester juniors in high school at the time of their review for possible admission to Austin College. The college welcomes such applications with the understanding that successful candidates display a high degree of social maturity and present strong academic credentials. An admission interview and a letter of recommendation from a parent or guardian are required in addition to standard admission materials and requirements. Students desiring Early Admission should take the SAT or ACT prior to applying for admission.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply/deadlines	p			Financial aid is available to Early Admission students if they are determined eligible after completion and analysis of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, it is mandatory by law that the students pass an independently administered standardized exam approved by the Department of Education. Both the ACT and SAT exams are approved for this purpose, if administered on one of the national test dates by a testing authority other than Austin College.

https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	b			Holistic Review
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			Admission to Austin College is very competitive. The College annually receives three to four applications for each space in the freshman class. If you are academically well-prepared and would like to be a part of this living and learning community, we urge you to apply.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			To be considered for admission at Austin College, students should be in good academic standing, taking classes which are challenging. Your transcript should include a nice distribution of courses, in true liberal arts style.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			Freshmen, remember to continue to take a full load of core courses your senior year of high school.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			Keep in mind that a decent grade in a challenging class is more impressive than an easy A. For applicants that elect to submit test scores for admission consideration, Austin College accepts both the ACT or SAT and as policy we “super score”. (We will take your highest subscores from different test dates and combine them to make a highest “super score”. We feel what is important is that we see your highest potential in each sub-section, not just how you scored overall during one test session.)
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p		strong	We recognize that for select students, standardized test scores do not accurately measure the student’s full potential for success at Austin College. Though each applicant undergoes a 
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	strong			holistic
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			 review, one in which we look beyond the numbers into the whole person, we are delighted to offer a test optional admission track. The test optional admission track requires students to submit a graded expository writing paper with final grade and teacher comments. We also recommend that test optional applicants complete an interview with an admission counselor. This track is available to all U.S. applicants who attend an accredited private or public high school. Homeschool and International applicants must submit test scores.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			In considering your application for admission, we’ll be looking for glimpses of the whole person in order to determine whether you’re right for us and us for you. We expect your extracurricular activities, recommendations from counselors and teachers, admission essay and interview with a member of our admission staff to tell us the rest of the story about who you are and what you value.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	b			Peaceful Protest will not Impact Admission
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	a			Austin College’s Mission Statement
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			 embraces opportunities for students to engage in a climate of civility and respect that encourages free inquiry and open expression of ideas. We are a community that fosters lively intellectual and social interaction among persons of different origins, experiences, beliefs, accomplishments, and goals.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	strong			Students, be confident in your rights.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			 Rest assured your admission status will not be jeopardized by peacefully and lawfully exercising your rights to protest.
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	b			Students Impacted by Natural Disasters
https://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply	p			We understand that you may need extra time, support, and assistance in completing your admission application. Please contact us to discuss ways we can assist you or offer flexibility through the application process.

http://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply/deadlines	strong			Early Admission
http://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply/deadlines	p			: Austin College accepts applications from qualified students who seek Early Admission. Normally, these students will be classified as second-semester juniors in high school at the time of their review for possible admission to Austin College. The college welcomes such applications with the understanding that successful candidates display a high degree of social maturity and present strong academic credentials. An admission interview and a letter of recommendation from a parent or guardian are required in addition to standard admission materials and requirements. Students desiring Early Admission should take the SAT or ACT prior to applying for admission.
http://www.austincollege.edu/admission/apply/deadlines	p			Financial aid is available to Early Admission students if they are determined eligible after completion and analysis of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, it is mandatory by law that the students pass an independently administered standardized exam approved by the Department of Education. Both the ACT and SAT exams are approved for this purpose, if administered on one of the national test dates by a testing authority other than Austin College.
