https://oru.edu	h3			DR. WILLIAM M. WILSON
https://oru.edu	p			As President of the globally recognized Oral Roberts University, Dr. William M. Wilson                         is developing Holy Spirit-empowered leaders through whole person education to impact                         the world.                       
https://oru.edu	p			Since taking office in 2013, Wilson has led ORU through consecutive years of dramatic                         enrollment growth, established global alliances on every continent, and spearheaded                         numerous campus improvements including the first new campus housing since 1976; the                         award-winning Global Learning Center, which harnesses the power of augmented and virtual                         reality; the ONEOK Sports Complex with state-of-the art track and tennis facilities;                         an intramural complex; and the  opening of ORU's Nursing and Engineering. Complex                         which is also home to the new Stovall Center for Entrepreneurship.                      
https://oru.edu	p			"Wilson also serves as Global Co-chair of Empowered21, an initiative that unites ministry                         leaders, scholars, and next-generation voices from the Spirit-empowered movement and                         the chair of the Pentecostal World Fellowship. He also hosts a global television program,                         ""World Impact with Dr. Billy Wilson"".                      "
https://oru.edu	p			Wilson is the author of several books, including Father Cry, Foundations of Faith,                         and Fasting Forward. He and his wife, Lisa, have two children and six grandchildren.                      
https://oru.edu	h2			Student SPOTLIGHT
https://oru.edu	h3			Karina Salcedo 
https://oru.edu	p			As soon as Karina Salcedo set foot on the campus of Oral Roberts University, she knew                         that it was where the Lord wanted her. “Once I stepped on [ORU’s] campus, I felt the                         power of the Holy Spirit. I loved it so much!” She knew without a doubt that she had                         to come to ORU.                      
https://oru.edu	p			Karina also knew that for her to attend ORU, the Lord would have to make a way. “I                         wouldn’t have been able to afford college at all,” she said. She had enough scholarships                         to attend another university, so switching to ORU was a huge leap of faith. When                             she received the news that her tuition would be paid for by the Quest Whole Leader                         Scholarship, she started to cry. When she was a little girl, her parents had told                         her that they would not be able to pay for her education. For years, she prayed and                         believed in faith that God would provide, and the Quest Scholarship became her answer                         to prayer.                      
https://oru.edu	p			The Quest Whole Leader Scholarship changed Karina’s life, and she has a lot to say                         about its impact: “This scholarship is a seed to be invested in the world’s best-of-the-                         best leaders, the world’s leading attorneys, the world’s leading politicians, the                         world’s leading evangelists, and missionaries, and pastors. At ORU, we are called                         to be the most excellent in every single field, and we are called to reach the uttermost                         bounds of the earth. Karina has big plans to impact thousands by bringing truth to                         the justice system—someday, she dreams of becoming President of the United States!                      
https://oru.edu	h3			John Rimando
https://oru.edu	p			It had always been one of John Rimando’s dreams to attend a Christian university in                         the United States, but he knew this would never be possible unless the Lord provided.                         In high school, he learned about Oral Roberts University, and the mission and vision                         caught his eye. Reflecting on the mission, John said, “ORU’s overall mission is not                         only to help encourage students to make God’s voice known and go to the uttermost                         bounds of the earth like Oral Roberts said, but it is also to teach students how to                         be competent at anything and everything that they do.”                       
https://oru.edu	p			When John found out he had indeed been awarded a Quest Whole Leader Scholarship, he                         was incredibly grateful. He said, “I remember running downstairs to my parents’ office                         and we all celebrated, and we had cake. That’s how you celebrate in my family—with                         food. We all celebrated, and my parents prayed for me, thanking the Lord for this                         provision.”                      
https://oru.edu	p			John is studying Psychology and Sociology at ORU, and his dream is to move back to                         the Philippines and focus on the youth. “The Philippines really struggle with psychological                         help. I want to try to implement mental healthcare with free education for the young                         population. This way, they will be preoccupied and recognize what they could do with                         their life.” John feels very strongly that his time at ORU—specifically, his time                         in ORU’s culturally diverse environment—is equipping him to overcome the challenges                         he will face in the future. “I am learning how to approach different people with different                         backgrounds in the best way.”

http://www.oru.edu	h2			SPOTLIGHT
http://www.oru.edu	h3			DR. WILLIAM M. WILSON
http://www.oru.edu	p			As President of the globally recognized Oral Roberts University, Dr. William M. Wilson                         is developing Holy Spirit-empowered leaders through whole person education to impact                         the world.                       
http://www.oru.edu	p			Since taking office in 2013, Wilson has led ORU through consecutive years of dramatic                         enrollment growth, established global alliances on every continent, and spearheaded                         numerous campus improvements including the first new campus housing since 1976; the                         award-winning Global Learning Center, which harnesses the power of augmented and virtual                         reality; the ONEOK Sports Complex with state-of-the art track and tennis facilities;                         an intramural complex; and the  opening of ORU's Nursing and Engineering. Complex                         which is also home to the new Stovall Center for Entrepreneurship.                      
http://www.oru.edu	p			"Wilson also serves as Global Co-chair of Empowered21, an initiative that unites ministry                         leaders, scholars, and next-generation voices from the Spirit-empowered movement and                         the chair of the Pentecostal World Fellowship. He also hosts a global television program,                         ""World Impact with Dr. Billy Wilson"".                      "
http://www.oru.edu	p			Wilson is the author of several books, including Father Cry, Foundations of Faith,                         and Fasting Forward. He and his wife, Lisa, have two children and six grandchildren.                      
http://www.oru.edu	h2			Student SPOTLIGHT
http://www.oru.edu	h3			Karina Salcedo 
http://www.oru.edu	p			As soon as Karina Salcedo set foot on the campus of Oral Roberts University, she knew                         that it was where the Lord wanted her. “Once I stepped on [ORU’s] campus, I felt the                         power of the Holy Spirit. I loved it so much!” She knew without a doubt that she had                         to come to ORU.                      
http://www.oru.edu	p			Karina also knew that for her to attend ORU, the Lord would have to make a way. “I                         wouldn’t have been able to afford college at all,” she said. She had enough scholarships                         to attend another university, so switching to ORU was a huge leap of faith. When                             she received the news that her tuition would be paid for by the Quest Whole Leader                         Scholarship, she started to cry. When she was a little girl, her parents had told                         her that they would not be able to pay for her education. For years, she prayed and                         believed in faith that God would provide, and the Quest Scholarship became her answer                         to prayer.                      
http://www.oru.edu	p			The Quest Whole Leader Scholarship changed Karina’s life, and she has a lot to say                         about its impact: “This scholarship is a seed to be invested in the world’s best-of-the-                         best leaders, the world’s leading attorneys, the world’s leading politicians, the                         world’s leading evangelists, and missionaries, and pastors. At ORU, we are called                         to be the most excellent in every single field, and we are called to reach the uttermost                         bounds of the earth. Karina has big plans to impact thousands by bringing truth to                         the justice system—someday, she dreams of becoming President of the United States!                      
http://www.oru.edu	h3			John Rimando
http://www.oru.edu	p			It had always been one of John Rimando’s dreams to attend a Christian university in                         the United States, but he knew this would never be possible unless the Lord provided.                         In high school, he learned about Oral Roberts University, and the mission and vision                         caught his eye. Reflecting on the mission, John said, “ORU’s overall mission is not                         only to help encourage students to make God’s voice known and go to the uttermost                         bounds of the earth like Oral Roberts said, but it is also to teach students how to                         be competent at anything and everything that they do.”                       
http://www.oru.edu	p			When John found out he had indeed been awarded a Quest Whole Leader Scholarship, he                         was incredibly grateful. He said, “I remember running downstairs to my parents’ office                         and we all celebrated, and we had cake. That’s how you celebrate in my family—with                         food. We all celebrated, and my parents prayed for me, thanking the Lord for this                         provision.”                      
http://www.oru.edu	p			John is studying Psychology and Sociology at ORU, and his dream is to move back to                         the Philippines and focus on the youth. “The Philippines really struggle with psychological                         help. I want to try to implement mental healthcare with free education for the young                         population. This way, they will be preoccupied and recognize what they could do with                         their life.” John feels very strongly that his time at ORU—specifically, his time                         in ORU’s culturally diverse environment—is equipping him to overcome the challenges                         he will face in the future. “I am learning how to approach different people with different                         backgrounds in the best way.”
