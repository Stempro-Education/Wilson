http://www.okwu.edu/disclosure	p			Online students who are eligible for Pell grant and will be eligible for a refund after the aid has posted may purchase his/her books through the OKWU/Founders bookstore as a charge on their account. The amount of your book purchase will be added to the balance due and deducted from the refund amount after the financial aid posts in August. If you withdraw, drop classes, or lose financial aid eligibility, you will be responsible for repaying this charge along with any tuition or fees that are due.  This is not a grant but is allowing you to use excess financial aid to purchase books prior to the actual financial aid posting onto your account.
