http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	a			Leadership Giving
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			Ringling College is a world-class institution where your investment will be mean the difference in the future of aspiring artists and designers. Leadership Giving is a powerful statement of commitment to the education of our students.  Here are some ways to contribute:
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	h4			Scholarships
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			Scholarships bridge the gap between a cost of a college education and the resources of the college student. Education and success go hand in hand. But what if a deserving student misses the opportunity to become a successful entrepreneur, filmmaker, teacher, or artist due to financial contraints? And what about the world- how can that loss be measured? 
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			Scholarships enable students to pursue their dreams, motivate them to aim high and prepare them for a lifetime of achievement. You can help make these dreams a reality.
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			More than 80% of our students qualify for need and merit based support, and most could not attend without assistance from donors.  Your annual contribution to the Student Scholarship Fund will enable Ringling College to award scholarships to deserving students who have demonstrated financial need.
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			Additionally there are opportunities to establish an endowed scholarship at Ringling College to create a lasting legacy. Interest income generated annually by the endowment fund will be awarded as student scholarships to support deserving students for generations to come. These named endowed scholarships can be established with your contribution of $50,000 or more.
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	h4			New Initiatives and Programs
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			Donors can support individual academic courses or areas of concentration, student services, visiting artists and scholars, lectures, research projects, Student Life programs, exhibitions, publications, awards, and travel grants, as well as new buildingresources which enable students and faculty to enrich their studies and college experience.
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	h4			The Sarasota Museum of Art
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	em			Changing perspectives through contemporary art. 
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			The Sarasota Museum of Art, a division of Ringling College of Art and Design, will serve as a catalyst for appreciation and understanding of world-class contemporary art by artists both established and emerging. A platform for education and exposure, the Museum will be a haven of the avant-garde for audiences of all levels of experience with contemporary artwork. Having no permanent collection, the Museum will be flexible and timely through an endless rotation of transformative, relevant, and pioneering new exhibitions and programs. At its core a learning institution, the Sarasota Museum of Art will host community education programs and courses to immerse audiences in the conceptual power of contemporary art.
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	h4			Film Program Post Production Studio and Soundstage
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			When you support the Ringling College Film Program, you support so much more than you could imagine. You help prepare students to become the next generation of remarkable, award winning filmmakers. 
http://www.ringling.edu/Advancement	p			Scholarships, equipment, location travel and interaction with industry leaders are some of the key components to ensure that our talented students receive an excellent education. Ringling College invites you to be a part of this dynamic cultural environment. By doing so, together we can attract the industry’s most compelling artists to Sarasota. Together, we can enrich lives, change perspectives and at the same time, improver the economy of our region. Let’s make this happen! '=
