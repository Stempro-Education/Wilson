http://www.coa.edu/admissions/apply	div			                                 A​t COA, we know that grades on a transcript tell only one part of your story.

For instance, you might describe a class or educational experience that inspired or influenced you, or difficult circumstances that may have impacted your grades.                               
http://www.coa.edu/admissions/apply	li			College of the Atlantic is, in many ways, not a typical college. COA’s self-designed program, our close-knit community of 350 students from around the world, and our engaged and interdisciplinary curriculum tend to attract students who are looking for a different kind of educational experience. Please describe, in one or two paragraphs, what you’re looking for from your college experience and why you think COA could be a good school for you.
