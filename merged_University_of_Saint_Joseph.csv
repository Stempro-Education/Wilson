https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	span			minutes
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p			The support of donors, along with fiscally-sound budget management and an unwavering commitment to academic excellence, made 2019 a successful year both financially and academically for the University of Saint Joseph. Delivering on our promise to provide values and value to students, the University continued to invest in modernizing campus facilities and updating academic offerings while strategically managing expenses.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		Academic improvements included new undergraduate completion programs for a growing population of adult students, and a new undergraduate program in Digital Media and Communication with concentrations available in Sport Media or Spanish Media. We were able to strengthen academic offerings through a Connecticut Health & Educational Facilities Authority Grant that provided funds for the purchase of new laboratory equipment for biomedical teaching and student-faculty research and updated computer science labs.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		Highlights from Institutional Advancement include a prestigious $649,000 National Science Foundation award for a STEM Scholars program, significant bequests, dedicated pledges for the reconstruction of our tennis courts, and donor contributions for a range of needs from endowed scholarships to resources for performing arts, athletics, and the School for Young Children. The Blue and Gold Club brought new friends to campus in support of our men’s and women’s basketball teams.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		This past year the University received two notable designations: In June, the Conference for Mercy Higher Education granted USJ a certificate of continuing sponsorship after a Mission Integration self-study/site visit process. In March, the Art Museum received the prestigious American Alliance of Museums designation, the highest recognition in the U.S. afforded the nation’s museums, meaning that the Museum meets the National Standards and Best Practice for U.S. Museums.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		On campus, 2019 will be known as the year of construction, with new ramps and doors for buildings across campus to improve accessibility, an artificial turf field for the increasing numbers of student-athletes, behind-the-scenes infrastructure improvements to enhance technology capabilities, and renovations to McGovern Hall that will provide students with reconfigured dining service options, more flexible meeting space, and a new bookstore.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		Plans to sustain USJ’s growth were realized in 2019 with the generosity and dedication of the entire USJ community, for which we are very grateful. Thank you for your commitment to the University’s future; please stay up-to-date with USJ news by visiting us online or in-person.

https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h2			Mission Statement
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	em			The University of Saint Joseph, founded by the Sisters of Mercy in the Catholic tradition, provides a rigorous liberal arts and professional education for a diverse student population in an inclusive environment that encourages strong ethical values, personal integrity, and a sense of responsibility to the needs of society.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h1			University Finances
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h2	h1	br	IN 2019 WE MANAGED THE UNIVERSITY’S FINANCES 
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h2	h1		TO ENSURE LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h1			Philanthropy Advances Strategic Plan 2020
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	span		USJ’s Strategic Plan 2020 challenges us to create a vibrant and engaging campus life and provide programs, services, and facilities that meet the diverse needs of the University’s students.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		In 2019, the generosity of USJ’s alumni and friends advanced this goal.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		An alumna’s pledge of $1 million to support the strategic plan set the tone for a very successful 2019. This individual’s commitment to advancing USJ gave the school the financial flexibility to pursue significant improvements across campus. With the renovation of McGovern Hall and the expansion to the O’Connell Athletic Center, student-focused facilities are undergoing the most significant improvements that we have seen in decades.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		A $200,000 grant from the Elizabeth Ferry Spears Foundation allowed USJ to begin the process of redesigning and renovating our tennis courts, which were in disrepair. An additional $50,000 gift from The Richard Garmany Fund, and contributions from several individuals, allowed us to complete the project this fall. Our six new state-of-the-art, post-tension concrete courts are now ready for play. The improvement to this facility allows USJ to add men’s tennis to our already popular women’s program, strengthening student recruitment, and adding vitality to our campus community. Not only will varsity athletes enjoy these courts, but all students will have recreational access, and these courts will allow us to offer adaptive tennis programs during the summer months.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		A sizable grant from CHEFA launched campus-wide improvements to accessibility by upgrading ramps, doors, curb cuts, and signage. By improving access, our campus becomes a more welcoming place for all who wish to participate in our educational and cultural programs. Increased access, increased participation, increased campus life.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		In addition, generous donors contributed $1.2 million to endowed scholarships this year. These scholarships allow us to offer competitive financial aid packages to students who might not otherwise be able to afford a USJ education. So, many more students whose first choice is USJ can enroll. These are highly motivated students whose dreams are to study at USJ and live the vision and values.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		Overall, 1,700 people contributed more than $4 million during FY19, investing in the educational, cultural, and recreational vitality of the University of Saint Joseph.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h2		br	Thank you for supporting
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	h2			USJ in 2019
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	span		Recently, I came across an interesting statistic; when donors are asked why they give, more than 85 percent respond because I was asked. Each year, we ask you, our alumni and friends, to invest in the University of Saint Joseph. We ask our neighbors and colleagues to contribute to a college education that changes lives. And year after year, our generous donors respond.
https://www.usj.edu/annualreport19	p	p		In 2019, we received a huge range of contributions from hundreds of donors that together helped us support more students’ education, faculty resources, and investments in our campus. Whatever the amount, they trust the University of Saint Joseph will continue to provide our students with an education that is academically rigorous and grounded in our Mercy values. Some are inspired by gratitude for the education that they received at Saint Joe’s, and some are motivated to strengthen our community by helping hard-working students achieve their educational and professional goals. Whatever inspires you to give back, please know that your gift makes a positive difference and all of us at USJ are grateful for your generosity.

http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	h2			Mission Statement
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	i			The University of Saint Joseph, founded by the Sisters of Mercy in the Roman Catholic tradition,                provides a rigorous liberal arts and professional education for a diverse student population while maintaining a strong commitment to developing the potential of women.
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	i			The University is a community which promotes the growth of the whole person in a caring environment that encourages strong ethical values, personal integrity and a sense of responsibility to the needs of society.

http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	h4			Meeting the needs of the 21st century student
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	p		i	Our students are better prepared for employment when they have real-world experience that extends beyond our college campus. Eighty-five percent of employers believe college students should complete an applied learning project.* The trend of internships, clinical placements, or field experiences is not new for USJ and our students. Since its founding in 1932, the University's educational philosophy has encompassed learning by doing. 
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	i			"""Applied, experiential education continues to be a hallmark of the USJ student experience."""
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	p			 said Rhona Free. 
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	p			That is true for Janay Diaz '18 a USJ business major who interns in Human Resources for a USJ alumna at Tilcon, Jacqueline Zimmer '07. She will be receiving internship credits for her work and reports how she has gained workplace skills and experiences that supplement her classroom education.

http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	h1			The Power of Each and Every Gift
http://www.usj.edu/annualreport16	p			I hope that you find this report to be an informative summary of the achievements and aspirations of our community. Most of all, I hope that it communicates to our donors that their gifts have a meaningful impact. For every scholarship fund, there is a student who is deeply committed to their studies; for every faculty research grant, there are important hypotheses being tested in fields such as biology, chemistry, pharmacology, ABA and education; for every capital gift there is an innovative space created to inspire future leaders. All of this is the result of generous individuals who believe in the University of Saint Joseph. On behalf of the faculty, staff and students, I offer my deepest gratitude for your investment in our mission.
