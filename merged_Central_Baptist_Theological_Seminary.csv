https://www.cbts.edu	h2			My Experience:
https://www.cbts.edu	p			I left my teaching position to help revitalize my grandfather’s farm. I asked myself, ‘If farming were to become my ministry, what would I build?’ Central is helping me consider how to make the farm ecological, sustainable, and economically viable, as well as theologically responsible.

https://www.cbts.edu	p			I have been at Central since the spring of 2014.  I can honestly say these past three and a half years have been absolutely incredible.  From meeting with professors, to building relationships with classmates, to pestering our librarians with questions, I have loved every minute of being at Central.  Every semester, or trimester, I am pushed and challenged to think in new ways about the divine.  I have been learning to think in ways that go far beyond just an academic experience.  What I have been learning has been impacting the way that I live each day.  I am so thankful for my time at Central and cannot recommend it enough.

http://www.cbts.edu	h2			My Experience:
http://www.cbts.edu	p		em	It was the careful and caring prodding of my professors that helped me move from envisioning ministry primarily as preaching and teaching to primarily caring for and creating community. During my journey towards a Master of Divinity degree, I have been blessed to learn from professors who are both intelligent 
http://www.cbts.edu	em			and
http://www.cbts.edu	p			 wise. They have encouraged me to push through some difficult personal experiences and beyond the limits of my self-perception. While they have imbued me with the technical knowledge necessary to perform my ministerial duties, they have also inspired me to think independently and to own my faith. There is, however, another essential element to my seminary experience that has greatly enriched me as a person – the diverse and faithful student community with whom I have had the privilege to learn. Both the faculty and the student body have contributed to my understanding of my calling, and many of the relationships forged during this experience will endure long after graduation.

http://www.cbts.edu	p			I started with Central Baptist Theological Seminary in 2010 as a student in the MDiv program. I wasn’t sure then and I am still not sure now what God has planned for me. I have been transitioning from a career in science to a calling in ministry and the experiences, classes and personal relationships I have been a part of with CBTS have helped me in my Camping Ministry with ABC of WI as well as my work in my church as CE Director. I also commute an hour and a half one way to classes each weekend and I have been the recipient of some wonderful hospitality from fellow students. We truly are a community. I am excited to see what is in store and I know I have a great support team!
