http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	div			Beards
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	p			Early in December, clean-shaven competitors sign up in three different categories (beards, goatees, and sideburns). Contestants have two months to grow the fullest facial hair possible. Finally, in an attempt to wow the judges, they show off their beards using costumes, songs, skits, and other shenanigans.
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	div			Broomball
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	p			Always intense, always a crowd favorite. Broomball is much like hockeyâexcept Huskies use duct-taped brooms for the stick, a mid-sized ball for the puck, and boots as skates. Players slide madly around the ice trying to put the ball past the goalie. Sounds simple if you've never tried it.
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	div			Cross Country Skiing
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	p			Student organizations compete in a roughly two-kilometer cross country ski race at the Tech Trails.
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	div			Curling
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	p			Students compete in this ancient Scottish game at the Calumet Drill House, where they throw granite stones across the ice and coax them along with brooms.
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	div			Downhill Skiing
http://www.mtu.edu/carnival/2020	p			Student organizations compete in a Giant Slalom-style event at Mont Ripley Ski hill where skiers weave through gates to reach the finish line.
