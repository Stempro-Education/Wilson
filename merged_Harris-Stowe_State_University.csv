http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	h1			The University Catalog: Introduction
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	p		a	The Harris-Stowe State University Catalog is a two-year publication, specifically created for informational purposes and should not be construed as a contractual agreement between the University and a student. The Harris-Stowe State University Catalog governs the curricular requirements of all students entering the University during the 2018-2020 academic years. Every effort is made to provide the most accurate information at the time of publication. However, policies, regulations and other provisions within this catalog may change without notice. Each entering student should preserve his or her copy of the catalog for reference during his or her entire matriculation at Harris-Stowe State University. Furthermore, each student should refer to subsequent editions of the catalog for any changes. Reference copies of the University Catalog are available at the AT&T Library and Technology Resource Center, as well as various administrative offices. It can also be found on the University’s website at 
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	a			www.hssu.edu
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	p			The University Catalog, under which a student is admitted or last readmitted to a degree program at Harris-Stowe State University, shall be understood to be the governing statement regarding that student’s program of study. This document shall remain as such for that particular student as long as he or she retains an unbroken series of semester enrollments in his or her major field, from the point of last admittance.
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	p			Changes in this policy will be made only by the University in compliance with new or amended laws, regulations or accrediting standards issued by federal and state government or relevant accrediting bodies. When a student changes his or her major field of study, the student must adopt the requirements of the new program in effect at the time of the change in the current, and not the previous catalog.
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	strong			STATEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	p			The Board of Regents and Harris-Stowe State University are committed to the policy that there shall be no discrimination either in employment or in the admission of students based on race, creed, color, sex, age, national origin, handicap, religion, marital or veteran’s status. This policy pertains to all educational programs and activities, as well as the areas cited above.
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	p			Pursuant to and in addition to this policy, the University abides by the requirements of Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Revised Order No. 4, Executive Orders 11246 and 71374, Sections 799A and 845 of the Public Health Service Act, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veteran’s Readjustment Act of 1974 and other federal regulations and pertinent acts of Congress.
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	strong			FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT POLICY
http://www.hssu.edu/catalog	div			Harris-Stowe State University complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) as amended December 2nd, 2011. FERPA is a federal law which controls the confidentiality of, and access to, student educational records. Harris-Stowe State University notifies its students of their rights to inspect, amend and prevent disclosure of their educational records. Therefore, the University treats student educational records in a confidential manner and will only disclose information from a student’s record with the expressed written consent of the student, except as permitted by law. Permitted disclosures include University  officials who have legitimate educational interests, officials of other institutions in which a student seeks enrollment, federal and state educational authorities under certain circumstances, officials connected with a student’s request for or receipt of financial aid, parents providing a significant portion of the cost of attendance for a dependent student, persons named in a judicial order or lawfully  issued subpoena and appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency.
