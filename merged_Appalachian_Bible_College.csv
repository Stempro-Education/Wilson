https://abc.edu/giving	i			It's that simple!
https://abc.edu/giving	h2			What about planned giving?
https://abc.edu/giving	p			Begin a legacy with eternal implications by creating a scholarship for worthy students. Or, leave a legacy of eternal value      through a trust or will, charitable gift annuities, gifts of real estate, or tax-deferred      retirement assets; these are popular because of their financial flexibility and tax benefits.    
https://abc.edu/giving	h3			Create a Scholarship
https://abc.edu/giving	p			         Every April, ABC celebrates the grace of God in an Awards Chapel. Over thirty students are surprised with scholarships that answer their prayers,         build their faith, and allow them to continue ministry training the next year. The problem is that there are more worthy         students than there are scholarships.
https://abc.edu/giving	p			         Fill out the form below if you are interested in creating a scholarship with ABC and we will contact you with further information.

https://abc.edu/giving	h2			How does your gift make a difference?
https://abc.edu/giving	p		div	It is no exaggeration to say that ABC could not exist without the faithful support of donors like you who contribute to the mission of     ABC. Your heart for Bible-based ministry training demonstrated through your monetary gifts allows us to keep costs to a minimum     while offering the highest in quality education. Our staff and students are immeasurably blessed as they see God provide for their needs     through brothers and sisters in Christ like you.     
https://abc.edu/giving	blockquote		p	Receiving the scholarship during chapel was a massive blessing to me! Going into my junior year, I was unsure       of how I would provide the funds for my college tuition; however, God reassured me early on that He would make a path       for me to return to ABC, if it was in His will.  
https://abc.edu/giving	p			 -Zach, 2019 Scholarship Recipient       
https://abc.edu/giving	blockquote		p	Our ministry's supporters provide a continual reminder to me: this is God's work! He provides for it and he        brings fruit from it. I truly look forward to the day when we gather in his presence and rejoice together over the        harvest, like John 4:36 says. Thank you to everyone who gives generously!
