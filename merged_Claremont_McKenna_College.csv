https://kravislab.cmc.edu	p			The Kravis Lab for Social Impact aspires to be the world’s premier center for social entrepreneurship and innovation – a model for colleges and universities across the world.
https://kravislab.cmc.edu	p			How do we achieve this? We do it by building a program for student success. Our goal is for every student on campus to learn the core skills that they need to thrive in the 21st century. We want to show students how to do good in the world, while also doing well personally and professionally.
https://kravislab.cmc.edu	p			In practice, there are three pillars to the program:
https://kravislab.cmc.edu	p			1. Helping students learn the essential skills for success: We have identified 9 central skills that are rarely taught in schools, but which are necessary for people to succeed in the coming decades. We can train students in these skills; we can measure their progress and growth. Our ultimate goal is for all students on campus to attain mastery in at least one of these core skills.
https://kravislab.cmc.edu	p			2. Making the community a better place: We tap into the students’ strengths and talents to help benefit organizations that are “socially profitable.” In other words, students don’t just learn about the problems of the world; they become active problem-solvers, working with community members to create and track progress towards a better world.
https://kravislab.cmc.edu	p			3. Designing innovative initiatives to benefit tens of millions of lives – At the highest level, we encourage entrepreneurial students who wish to create bold, visionary plans that could transform the world. This part of our program isn’t for everyone. We are looking for those special students who want to pursue lives of great meaning and purpose.

https://rec.cmc.edu	p			This is a very exciting time for the Roberts Environmental Center, as we build on the prominence of having assessed the sustainability transparency of thousands of major companies, in order to deepen the analysis of environmental performance, environmental governance, and possibilities of greater cooperation in finding sustainable solutions to U.S. and international challenges. The broad variety of projects will be selected on the basis of student interests, with an eye to expanding their career choices. To fulfill our commitment to benefit the community at large, we shall collaborate with other organizations, ranging from corporations and non-governmental organizations to research institutes and government agencies.

https://rec.cmc.edu/gcc-2019	span			Please join the Roberts Environmental Center …
https://rec.cmc.edu/gcc-2019	span			On February 1, 2019, for our annual Green Careers Conference at Claremont McKenna to energize students around the breadth of environmental career possibilities and foster a discussion on key environmental issues and solutions.  A keynote presentation and panel presentations by green industry leaders will highlight the opportunities and challenges facing green jobs today in environmental law, consulting, nonprofits and corporate enterprise.
https://rec.cmc.edu/gcc-2019	span			Our goal for the Green Careers Conference is to give students a broad perspective of the careers available in the environmental field. Our team strives to show students how environment and economic objectives can be simultaneously achieved. Ultimately, we hope to motivate students to pursue careers that contribute to positive environmental change and start a tradition of engagement and leadership in environmental professions at the Claremont Colleges.
