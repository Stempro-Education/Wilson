http://travel.uconn.edu	strong			EXCITING NEWS!
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			  The University has been working towards implementing a new Travel and Expense System which will create a seamless process for employees to request, book, and expense travel!  Reimbursements will be more efficiently processed, allowing travelers to receive their payments in a timely manner.   We want to thank the areas across the campus who have helped pilot this system: Athletics, ITS, Admissions, Statistics, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB), History, and the School of Business.  These groups have worked diligently with the project team to ensure that the system is ready for a full campus roll out later this year.

http://travel.uconn.edu	p			We are excited to be getting close to the launch of our Concur Travel and Expense system.  As part of this system implementation, the University has decided to offer Travel Cards to employees (Faculty, Staff, Grad Assistants, Grad Interns, and Post-Docs).  These Travel Cards are backed by the University and do not impact your credit.

http://travel.uconn.edu	h1			University Travel Program Update
http://travel.uconn.edu	time			November 8, 2019
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			We want to provide you with a further update on the changes occurring to the University’s Travel Program. You will recall we sent out a message in June announcing:
http://travel.uconn.edu	li			Key Travel will be our new travel management partner;
http://travel.uconn.edu	li			Travel Card program will be established;
http://travel.uconn.edu	li			We will begin the use of Concur, a travel and expense management system.
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			This past October 15, Key Travel, Travel Cards and Concur began being piloted with certain users. The pilot group consists of the following departments: School of Business, Office of Admissions, Division of Athletics, Information Technology Services, and Departments of Statistics, History, and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.

http://travel.uconn.edu	p			In the fall of 2019, a new and improved travel system will be available to you! With a commercial look and feel, backed by a 24/7 Travel Management Company (Key Travel), Concur will allow you to request pre-approval for travel, book travel, and easily complete your expense report for quick reimbursement. Concur also affords you the peace of mind knowing you are covered under the University’s Duty of Care system.

http://travel.uconn.edu	span			UPDATE AND REMINDER ON TRAVEL BAN TO NORTH CAROLINA AND MISSISSIPPI
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			Even though a partial repeal of the North Carolina law requiring transgender people to use public bathrooms matching their gender was repealed in March, the Governor Malloy’s Executive Orders banning travel to the states of North Carolina and Mississippi will continue to be in effect until further notice.
http://travel.uconn.edu	p		a	In order to assure consistency, decisions about approving travel under the Orders will continue to be made centrally.

http://travel.uconn.edu	a			Travel Ban
http://travel.uconn.edu	h1			Travel Ban
http://travel.uconn.edu	time			April 18, 2016
http://travel.uconn.edu	p		strong	The University is requiring 
http://travel.uconn.edu	u			pre approval for travel to North Carolina or Mississippi
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			.  Travel without pre approval may result in the traveler being denied reimbursement.
http://travel.uconn.edu	p		a	At Storrs, the regional campuses and the Law school, requests for travel to North Carolina or Mississippi should be submitted to the Controller (Charlie Eaton) via email at 
http://travel.uconn.edu	a			charles.eaton@uconn.edu
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			.  His office and General Counsel will collaborate to review individual requests for travel to North Carolina or Mississippi and determine whether they may be approved.
http://travel.uconn.edu	li		span	Travel funded by non-state funds (e.g. federal grants or private industry contracts) will be approved.  The ban applies to use of state 
http://travel.uconn.edu	li			funds.
http://travel.uconn.edu	li			Travel in which North Carolina or Mississippi is only a layover for a change of planes is not travel “to” that state and does not come within the ban.
http://travel.uconn.edu	li			If the Executive Order is expanded to apply to other states, the process described above will be applied to travel to those states as well.
http://travel.uconn.edu	p			Travelers, particularly for academic or research purposes, should not assume their request for travel to North Carolina or Mississippi on state funds will be denied, but should instead submit for review.
