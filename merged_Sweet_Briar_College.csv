https://sbc.edu	a			Sweet Briar makes Princeton Review’s list of Best Southeastern colleges for 2020
https://sbc.edu	p			Sweet Briar has once again been crowned a Best Southeastern college by The Princeton Review. According to the annual publication’s “Region by Region” web feature, the 656 schools on the five lists (Northeastern, Southeastern, Midwestern, Western and International) are deemed “academically outstanding and well worth consideration in your college search.”

https://sbc.edu	a			Significant gift from Richard C. Colton Jr. will advance Sweet Briar College riding program
https://sbc.edu	p			Well-known philanthropist Richard C. Colton Jr. has given $1 million to Sweet Briar College to support the renovation of the College’s stables, which will be named the Howell Lykes Colton ’38 Stables in honor of his mother.
https://sbc.edu	a			A half decade of sweet work
https://sbc.edu	p			This year, the College’s new tradition of Sweet Work Weeks marked its fifth year and in that relatively short period of time, the annual event has become almost as big as Reunion weekend. Participants paint, weed, mulch and more — all to welcome students home for a new academic year. Of course, it’s about more than just work. It’s also an opportunity for alumnae of different generations to get to know each other in a meaningful way. We are so grateful for the hard work of all of our amazing alumnae that we wanted to take a moment to honor some of the women — and some husbands — who have become regular attendees at Sweet Work Weeks.

http://sbc.edu	a			Sweet Briar makes Princeton Review’s list of Best Southeastern colleges for 2020
http://sbc.edu	p			Sweet Briar has once again been crowned a Best Southeastern college by The Princeton Review. According to the annual publication’s “Region by Region” web feature, the 656 schools on the five lists (Northeastern, Southeastern, Midwestern, Western and International) are deemed “academically outstanding and well worth consideration in your college search.”

http://sbc.edu	p			Well-known philanthropist Richard C. Colton Jr. has given $1 million to Sweet Briar College to support the renovation of the College’s stables, which will be named the Howell Lykes Colton ’38 Stables in honor of his mother.
http://sbc.edu	a			A half decade of sweet work
http://sbc.edu	p			This year, the College’s new tradition of Sweet Work Weeks marked its fifth year and in that relatively short period of time, the annual event has become almost as big as Reunion weekend. Participants paint, weed, mulch and more — all to welcome students home for a new academic year. Of course, it’s about more than just work. It’s also an opportunity for alumnae of different generations to get to know each other in a meaningful way. We are so grateful for the hard work of all of our amazing alumnae that we wanted to take a moment to honor some of the women — and some husbands — who have become regular attendees at Sweet Work Weeks.
