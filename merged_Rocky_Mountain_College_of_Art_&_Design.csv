https://www.rmcad.edu	p		span	Class of 2019 
https://www.rmcad.edu	span			Fashion Design
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		I design for the powerful woman who wears garments with more coverage to inspire her.
https://www.rmcad.edu	a	p		Watch Video >
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Anna Vo
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		My only advice is: be confident and no matter what mistakes you made just keep going and you will go through it.
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	TJ Howell
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		This is my final hoorah so it’s very important that this kind of shows who I am as a designer and what my aesthetic and who I am most importantly.
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Haley Long
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		What makes me proud to be a RMCAD graduate is the fact that I’ve been challenged so incredibly much here and that it’s actually been applicable outside of RMCAD.
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Candace Feren
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		I’m proud to be a RMCAD graduate because there’s so many amazing staff here. They support you, challenge you and really push you to get where you need to be.
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Mark Fitzsimmons
https://www.rmcad.edu	p		span	Class of 2018 
https://www.rmcad.edu	span			Fine Arts
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		RMCAD gave me the space to experiment. All of the instructors I had let me take not only what I wanted but what I needed from the class I was in.
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Gregory Hayes
https://www.rmcad.edu	p		span	Class of 2006 
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		Ten years later I’ve developed a skill from my professor’s random act of kindness. That little bottle was the start of me dripping paint.
https://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Jenny Morgan
https://www.rmcad.edu	p		span	Class of 2003 
https://www.rmcad.edu	span	span		Illustration
https://www.rmcad.edu	span	span		Illustrative Design
https://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		RMCAD was really influential for me, the teachers I had were extremely impactful and I still keep in touch with them. I think a smaller school like RMCAD can be really beneficial in terms of making connections and keeping those connections.

http://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Anna Vo
http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		My only advice is: be confident and no matter what mistakes you made just keep going and you will go through it.
http://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	TJ Howell
http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		This is my final hoorah so it’s very important that this kind of shows who I am as a designer and what my aesthetic and who I am most importantly.
http://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Haley Long
http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		What makes me proud to be a RMCAD graduate is the fact that I’ve been challenged so incredibly much here and that it’s actually been applicable outside of RMCAD.
http://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Candace Feren
http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		I’m proud to be a RMCAD graduate because there’s so many amazing staff here. They support you, challenge you and really push you to get where you need to be.

http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		RMCAD gave me the space to experiment. All of the instructors I had let me take not only what I wanted but what I needed from the class I was in.
http://www.rmcad.edu	div	div	p	Gregory Hayes
http://www.rmcad.edu	p		span	Class of 2006 
http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		Ten years later I’ve developed a skill from my professor’s random act of kindness. That little bottle was the start of me dripping paint.

http://www.rmcad.edu	p	p		RMCAD was really influential for me, the teachers I had were extremely impactful and I still keep in touch with them. I think a smaller school like RMCAD can be really beneficial in terms of making connections and keeping those connections.
