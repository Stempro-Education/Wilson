http://art.ucsc.edu	p			The Art Department approaches art making as a rigorous creative practice, which can reflect upon, intervene and transform the world in which we live. Building upon the rich intellectual history and culture of UCSC, our faculty and staff are dedicated to and believe in the transformational potential of the creative arts. We value public education, diversity, intellectual rigor and skill building in our teaching, art making, and research. We see art practice as producing important creative strategies, practices, models and alternatives for envisioning the present and for moving into the future.
