https://www.up.edu/cav	a			Make a report
https://www.up.edu/cav	p			The University of Portland is committed to fostering a community in which all members feel respected and safe. Sexual and gender-based harassment, misconduct, and violence have no place at the University, are inconsistent with our mission and values as a Holy Cross university, and will not be tolerated.
https://www.up.edu/cav	p			The University believes that it is our community’s responsibility to prevent, educate, and effectively respond, and it is a responsibility the University takes very seriously. We recognize that a culture of respect and safety requires that each one of us — students, staff, faculty, and administrators — do our part when something occurs that is not consistent with our community’s values. Further, it is imperative that individuals affected by sexual and gender-based harassment, misconduct, and violence know they are not alone — that our community is here to help.
https://www.up.edu/cav	p			UP community members are encouraged to report incidents of sexual and gender-based harassment, misconduct, and violence to the Title IX Office. The University will take steps to appropriately address such reports and support affected community members.
https://www.up.edu/cav	p			Together, we can take a stand to be part of a community in which all members feel respected and safe. Join us in learning more about campus and community resources and reporting options, along with our education and prevention programs.

https://www.up.edu/cav	li			The University is exploring possibilities for a confidential advocate to be co-located on our campus. This advocate would be a confidential resource, separate from the Title IX Team, who is trained and knowledgeable in Title IX and associated issues.
https://www.up.edu/cav	li			Title IX Advisory Committee will be expanded during the 18-19 academic year to include greater representation, especially from student groups.
