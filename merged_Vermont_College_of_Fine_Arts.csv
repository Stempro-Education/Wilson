https://visualark.vcfa.edu	p			The first low-residency program in visual art in the country, the MFA in Visual Art at VCFA is a vibrant, local, national, and international community of artists and critical thinkers. The program’s precedent-setting pedagogy is based on the understanding that art does not exist in a void, but within a social context. Students emerge from the program with a dynamic new vision of themselves, their art, and the world around them.
