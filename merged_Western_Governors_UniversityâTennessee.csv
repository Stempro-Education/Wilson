https://www.wgu.edu	h3			WGU Frequently Asked Questions.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			"Is this program truly ""at your own pace""?"
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU offers flexible pacing, meaning you can move through courses at a pace that meets your learning style and knowledge level.  Students can go as fast as they can but not as slowly.  Students are required to complete a minimum number of competency units per term to meet on-time progress. However, if you choose to study at 3 am daily, that we can accommodate. 
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Do all my existing credits transfer to WGU?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU has a generous transfer policy. Our transcripts department can accept official copies of transcripts from your previous educational institutions for a course-by-course evaluation that compares the context of your courses to those in our programs, to tell you what is comparable and transferable.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			How quickly can you finish the program?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Your personal progress will be determined by the extent of your transfer units, your time commitment, and your determination to proceed at a faster rate. Traditionally, without an associate’s degree or equivalent, it will take 2 to 2.5 years.  Master's degree programs are designed to be completed within 2 years.  However, we work on a competency-based model, which gives you credit for passing assessments and proving you can perform a task or understand a course of study proficiently. 
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Can you skip ahead if you get done early?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Yes! If you are able to complete the minimum requirement before your term is over, you can add more courses, with no tuition increase.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Does WGU offer financial aid?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU is approved to offer federal student aid. You will need to apply using the FAFSA, which is used to determine your eligibility for aid. WGU’s FAFSA school code is 033394.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Is WGU accredited?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Yes! WGU is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU), the highest form of accreditation.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			How do WGU courses compare to classes in traditional schools?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU offers competency-based education. Competency-based learning means our online degrees are based on real-world competencies as opposed to seat time or credit hours.  Our focus in on ensuring you possess the skills and knowledge you need to be successful, not whether you’ve attended class or not.  If you already have knowledge in an area a course covers, you’ll be able to draw upon this experience to complete assessments faster, ultimately saving you both time and money.
https://www.wgu.edu	p			Does WGU offer job placement?
https://www.wgu.edu	p			WGU students and alumni have access to career services which include professional development, career exploration, and career planning. WGU also has partner employers who share full-time, part-time, and paid internship opportunities.
