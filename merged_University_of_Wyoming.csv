At UW, the Architectural Engineering program has a strong reputation for strength in Building Information Modeling, which refers to the 3D computer modeling of building systems and simulating building performance. We have faculty strength in the areas of Structural Engineering, and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) with a focus on smart buildings. Although architectural engineering students also take a small dose of architecture courses, it is not an architecture degree. This program also offers a summer Study Abroad program in Europe.

Civil engineers design roads and bridges, municipal water systems, sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants, dams and irrigation channels, excavations and slope-stability projects. Many civil engineers have the opportunity to work outdoors, and there are Civil Engineering jobs in small counties as well as big cities. At the University of Wyoming, the Civil Engineering faculty work on cutting-edge subjects such as Intelligent Transportation Systems and large-scale groundwater modeling.

Construction Management as an occupation is growing at a faster rate than any other occupation in the United States. The increasing complexity of new buildings and industrial (horizontal) construction prompts this growth along with an increase in projected retirements of current Construction Managers. The Construction Management program at the University of Wyoming seeks to prepare a future workforce capable of competing in and driving technological advancements in construction industries.

http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	h2			Why Civil and Architectural Engineering?
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	h3			Civil Engineering
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			Incoming freshmen experience at least one designed-based course each year in an innovative course sequence called VISTA (Vertically Integrated Science and Technology Application), where students tackle modern engineering challenges from their very first semester. 
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			Undergraduate students find on-campus opportunities in the research laboratories and with a unique cooperative learning experience on the Wyoming Department of Transportation’s Design Squad.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			Civil and architectural engineering jobs are projected to grow 20 percent by 2022.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			Graduates from our program find employment with public agencies, private firms and in industry in small towns and large cities nationwide. Our placement of students in positions or in graduate schools each year is nearly 100 percent.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 20 percent employment growth from 2012-2022 in civil engineering and 5 percent growth for architectural engineers.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	h3			Architectural Engineering
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			UW’s Architectural Engineering program has strong relationships with major employers and we have a great track record in internship and job placement.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			Our faculty is dedicated to excellent teaching and research in leading-edge topics within the discipline. The building industry has changed dramatically in the past decade, and we are proud of our dedication to staying current.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			If you prefer a hands-on education, Architectural Engineering is for you. You’ll find yourself building a brick wall in class, or going to visit a construction site. Bring your gloves and work boots!
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			If you enjoy computer models and simulations, Architectural Engineering is for you. UW is known for being at the forefront of computing. We have received national recognition three times for leadership in Building Information Modeling (BIM). We’ve found that UW graduates get more job offers and higher salaries because they can use the latest computing tools.
http://www.uwyo.edu/civil	li			Finally, as an architectural engineer, you can make a difference in helping to solve the world’s social problems. Buildings generally use too much energy, leading to a waste of capital and a problem for the climate and environment. We train students to understand how buildings can be designed to use less energy, and to keep the occupants healthy and happy.

http://www.uwyo.edu/epscor	h2			Current Project
http://www.uwyo.edu/epscor	a			Microbial Ecology
http://www.uwyo.edu/epscor	p		a	This project will study microbiomes across the state of Wyoming to help predict how different regions respond to environmental disturbances. The research aims to provide policy makers with tools to better manage natural resources. Microbial organisms are ubiquitous and abundant in soil and aquatic environments. These organisms play essential roles in cycling nutrients, decomposing organic matter and determining the fate of pollutants released by human activities. Samples of microbes will be collected from thousands of sites that differ in their local climate, land use and plant life. Samples will be analyzed to better understand the environmental roles of the microbes and their responses to changes in precipitation, soil properties and land use. Species composition and ecological relationships to the ecosystem will be determined using DNA, RNA and protein sequencing. Statistical methods will be used to uncover the relationships between microbes and how the overall ecosystems function.
