http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	I have rediscovered myself and my calling at Trinity. Trinity is the major 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 vehicle that God is using to prepare me for the next season of my life. 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 I am not the same woman I was when I sat in New Student Orientation. 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	h1	img		STUDENT STORIES
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	h3	a		- Devon Anderson ‘16
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	Attending a distinctively Christian law school originally wasn’t important 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 to me, but now I wouldn’t have it any other way. The lessons and 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 interactions are more genuine than in a secular setting. I see students 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 stepping out of their comfort zone and doing things in the community 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 not because it looks good on a resume, but because they want to do it.  
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	h3	a		- Ligya Valencia ‘19
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	We all come from different walks in life, different cultures, ages, backgrounds 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 and life experiences, yet we become part of an extended family that shares 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 a common love for law and justice. 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	h3	a		- Michelle Eaton ‘16
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	Trinity was my first choice, and it’s been more than I thought it would be. 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 Every person here really cares about us as individuals, not just as law students. 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 They care about our future as fellow Christians. 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	h3	a		- Brett Sternad '16
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	TLS has made a difference in my life by supplying the necessary tools 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 and  faculty to help me work diligently through my law school experience.
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	h3	a		- Jamileh Sarabian ‘14
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	The fact that I’m able to meet with my professors one-on-one, 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 and not just for a quick five minutes, is incredible. They will look 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 at the work that I’ve produced and go through it thoroughly. They 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 will listen and pray for any problems that I’m having. It is very 
http://lawschool.tiu.edu	p	h3	br	 unique and different from anything I’ve ever experienced.
