https://www.hmc.edu/diversity	h2			Mission
https://www.hmc.edu/diversity	p			The Office of Institutional Diversity develops, promotes, and supports a welcoming environment for underrepresented students, faculty, and staff in STEM by providing transformative and educational learning experiences.
https://www.hmc.edu/diversity	h2			Vision
https://www.hmc.edu/diversity	p			We seek to improve campus climate by positively impacting our campus community through the facilitation of a shared learning experience that engages our campus in dialogue, challenge barriers, build collaborative relationships, and provide educational opportunities. We strive to raise awareness about critical issues of inclusion and equity, we seek to foster a community of allies, and we aim to empower our community to take action on the issues that matter to them, guided by a social justice framework. This enables our campus community to explore all dimensions of diversity and the intersections of identity.
