http://www.shsst.edu	p		span	Since I arrived, until the last day, I did not feel like a student more than one summer course, I felt really welcome, I felt as a family, either with the parents and siblings of the Sacred Heart Community, for which I especially appreciate to Fr. Yvon and Br. Duane; in the same way by the teachers, to the point of sharing with some members of their families and so I take this opportunity to thank Vicki and her husband, Kelly and her family. Really, it was a wonderful day and I felt at home, very happy.
