http://www.methodist.edu	i			Why Methodist University?
http://www.methodist.edu	h3			 Small-School Environment
http://www.methodist.edu	p	h3		 With a student-to-faculty ratio of 12:1 and an average class size of 15 students, you will not get lost in the crowd.
http://www.methodist.edu	h3			 The MU Journey
http://www.methodist.edu	p	h3		 The MU Journey focuses on opportunities for students to be engaged outside the classroom through leadership, community engagement, global education, and research and creativity.
http://www.methodist.edu	h3			 Internships
http://www.methodist.edu	p	h3		 At MU, all students have the opportunity to complete an internship. A successful internship often translates into a job offer after graduation.
http://www.methodist.edu	h3			 Study Abroad
http://www.methodist.edu	p	h3		 Study Abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with benefits that go far beyond an academic education. Choose from short-term trips or semester exchanges around the world.
http://www.methodist.edu	h3			 MU at Night & Extended Learning
http://www.methodist.edu	p	h3		 Our program is designed to help working adults get their university degrees. We offer classes on our Main Campus, Ft. Bragg Campus, and online.
http://www.methodist.edu	h3			 Military Friendly® University
http://www.methodist.edu	p	h3		 G.I. Jobs has named MU a Military Friendly® School for eight straight years, and we are proud to serve our military, veterans, and dependents.
http://www.methodist.edu	i			Student Spotlights
http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		MU gave me many opportunities as a performer and as a teacher. I was able to make mistakes in a safe and supportive environment, and learn from those mistakes with the guidance of the MU professors. This helped me gain confidence in my abilities and myself, which is something I did not have four years ago. I brought that confidence to my interviews after graduation, and now, I bring it with me every day as I teach music classes, lead a choir, and run a musical theatre club. I am so proud to be a lifelong Monarch!

http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		Before attending, I visited Methodist University on countless occasions (MU is my older brother’s alma mater). After each visit, there was something new for me to love about this community. I met people who helped me grow on an unimaginable level. The faculty challenged me to think critically and to put myself into new situations. My MU experience left a lasting impression that I will apply to my practice as a new grad nurse at Duke Raleigh Hospital.

http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		I chose Methodist University because of the opportunity to play my favorite sport while being able to focus on my major. The welcoming community and small class sizes have helped me build relationships with students and professors. Being a part of the women’s lacrosse team has offered me new friendships and an outlet to grow mentally and physically.

http://www.methodist.edu	p	div	a	My Cincinnati Reds internship was the most amazing experience I have had on a job. I grew up a huge Reds fan, so getting to go to the ballpark every day to work was an unbelievable experience. The most memorable part was when we had what was referred to as ‘Intern Call Days’, where all the interns got to compete to see who could sell the most tickets in club seating. Without 
http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		, I never would have had a resume or cover letter to send, much less the interview skills to get the internship.

http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		Methodist has some of the best professors who go out of their way to ensure the material is being understood and students are excelling in their studies. I could not imagine a better undergraduate school experience than the one I have received at MU because of its strong impact on my life. I have gained knowledge, connections, and leadership abilities that I never thought possible. I have been heavily involved on and off campus, and it is all thanks to Methodist for providing me the resources to empower myself and others to be better versions of ourselves.

http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		. For my Nepal trip, I used their half scholarship, and for my Italy trip, I used their full scholarship. Without the Honors Program and without the funding through grants that Study Abroad offers, I would not be able to take these trips. I am so grateful that I go to a university where Study Abroad is encouraged, and they make it financially feasible for the students.

I am only a great leader now because I was in a great environment then, and I learned how to be a leader in the classroom, in the community, and in the workplace. I believe great leaders are molded, created, and nurtured; Methodist University did that for me every day for three and a half years.

http://www.methodist.edu	p	div	a	, served as chief justice for

http://www.methodist.edu	a			Religion
http://www.methodist.edu	p	div		 program at MU made sense. When you learn about what value systems motivate people, you are better able to relate to them in any capacity. As we become a more globalized society, learning about religions across the globe will be a crucial skill to have in one’s toolbox. Majoring in religion is an asset for anyone who plans to pursue a career that has a high rate of interaction with various people.

At Methodist, there are always academic events and trips, both on and off campus, and every student is welcome to participate. My internships with the U.S.-Japan Council and the Earth Identity Project gave me rewarding opportunities to complete communications-related projects and programmatic work with non-governmental and non-profit organizations.
