http://library.wadecollege.edu	p			Please feel free to contact us any time!
http://library.wadecollege.edu	h2			About the Library
http://library.wadecollege.edu	p			It is the ultimate goal of the Wade College Library, as it is of the institution itself, to create life-long learners, and to provide them with the tools to achieve that goal!
http://library.wadecollege.edu	p			In addition to general education resources, the college library provides access to a collection of specialized materials reflecting the college curriculum. The library is open to all faculty, staff, and students. Study space is available, with access to bound volumes as well as periodicals.
http://library.wadecollege.edu	p			The library's collection contains approximately 6,800 bound volumes, 134 periodical subscriptions, and 400 audiovisual items, including films, microfilms, videos, slides, and machine-readable units. The library also has electronic access to numerous indexes, databases, and full-text periodical sources, including an additional 75,500 titles through Ebrary and SciTech databases. The library provides interlibrary loan services and access to the Internet. There are computer workstations for student use, allowing access to the library's DVD and CD-ROM collection, as well as giving students additional locations to complete traditional computer tasks. New materials are constantly being added to the collection, with a special priority given to electronic resources.
http://library.wadecollege.edu	p			The library is staffed to assist students and faculty in obtaining materials they need to complement their classroom learning. Bibliographic instruction is available on a class-by-class basis or individually. Orientation is conducted each trimester, but assistance with the materials and services is available daily. In addition to personalized assistance, the librarians can also direct students to multiple sources of information.
http://library.wadecollege.edu	h2			Mission Statement
http://library.wadecollege.edu	p			The Wade College Library exists to provide services, materials, and information for the students, alumni faculty, and staff. The services, materials, and information available are chosen to support, reflect, and enhance the college's curriculum. To ensure the completion of this task, the college library maintains facilities which comply with the principles of its regional accreditation association, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. The library facilities are utilized as an intrinsic part of the educational program of the college; thus, funds are budgeted so the library can expand its holdings, including print and electronic volumes, reference books, periodicals, electronic databases, electronic books and/periodicals, audiovisual materials, and course-related computer software support. Information technology, on a scale appropriate to the institution, is employed to assist users in the location of materials and information. It is the ultimate goal of the Wade College Library, as it is of the institution itself, to create life-long learners, and to provide them with the tools to achieve that goal.
