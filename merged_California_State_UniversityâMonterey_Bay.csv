https://csumb.edu/clery	p	h2		The Clery Act requires higher education institutions to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses, and is enforced by the United States Department of Education.
https://csumb.edu/clery	p	p		The Clery Act requires colleges and universities to publish an annual security report  by October 1.  The law requires schools make the reports available to all current students and employees, and readily available to prospective students and employees upon request.
https://csumb.edu/clery	p	p		The report contains information regarding campus security and personal safety including topics such as: crime prevention, university police law enforcement authority, crime reporting policies, and disciplinary procedures. It also contains information about crime statistics for the three previous calendar years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus; in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by CSUMB; and on public property within, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.
