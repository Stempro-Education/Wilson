https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			Harvard is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States, established in 1636 by vote of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It was named after the College’s first benefactor, the young minister John Harvard of Charlestown, who upon his death in 1638 left his library and half his estate to the institution. A statue of John Harvard stands today in front of University Hall in Harvard Yard, and is perhaps the University’s best known landmark.

There are more than 360,000 living

https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	h3			The Harvard Shield
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p		a	On Sept. 8, 1836, at Harvard’s Bicentennial celebration, it was announced that President Josiah Quincy had found the 
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	a			first rough sketch
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			 of the College arms – a shield with the Latin motto “VERITAS” (“Verity” or “Truth”) on three books – while researching his History of Harvard University in the College Archives. During the Bicentennial, a white banner atop a large tent in the Yard publicly displayed this design for the first time.
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			Until Quincy’s discovery, the hand-drawn sketch (from records of an Overseers meeting on Jan. 6, 1644) had been filed away and forgotten. It became the basis of the seal officially adopted by the Corporation in 1843 and still informs the version used today.
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	h4			Harvard University Shields
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	h3			Why Crimson?
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			Crimson was officially designated as Harvard’s color by a vote of the Harvard Corporation in 1910. But why crimson? A pair of rowers, Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, and Benjamin W. Crowninshield, Class of 1858, provided crimson scarves to their teammates so that spectators could differentiate Harvard’s crew team from other teams during a regatta in 1858. Eliot became Harvard’s 21st president in 1869 and served until 1909; the Corporation vote to make the color of Eliot’s bandannas the official color came soon after he stepped down.
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			But before the official vote by the Harvard Corporation, students’ color of choice had at one point wavered between crimson and magenta – probably because the idea of using colors to represent universities was still new in the latter part of the 19th century. Pushed by popular debate to decide, Harvard undergraduates held a plebiscite on May 6, 1875, on the University’s color, and crimson won by a wide margin. The student newspaper – which had been called The Magenta – changed its name with the very next issue.
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	h3			U.S. Presidents and Honorary Degrees
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			After George Washington’s Continental Army forced the British to leave Boston in March 1776, the Harvard Corporation and Overseers voted on April 3, 1776, to confer an honorary degree upon the general, who accepted it that very day (probably at his Cambridge headquarters in Craigie House). Washington next visited Harvard in 1789, as the first U.S. president. 
https://harvard.edu/about-harvard/harvard-glance/history	p			Other U.S. presidents to receive an honorary degree include:
