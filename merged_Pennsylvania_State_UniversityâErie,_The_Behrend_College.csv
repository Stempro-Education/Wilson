http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	a			AD15
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			) is available at the respective Center. All service charges are subject to change.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			Users are also responsible for special custodial costs related to a specific use. Such custodial services will be arranged by the CPA Assistant Director (for events in Eisenhower Auditorium), the Associate Athletic Director for Facilities and Operations (for events in Recreation Building), or the General Manager (for events at Bryce Jordan Center).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			"There are no ""average"" cleaning costs for a typical use. Charges will vary according to the amount of time required to prepare and clean the facility, whether work must be performed on an overtime basis, and the amount of services needed."
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	a			TICKETS
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			All tickets for events staged at Eisenhower Auditorium, the Playhouse and Pavilion Theaters, the Recreation Building, and the Bryce Jordan Center may be purchased through the integrated Penn State ticket system. Current practice permits football tickets to be purchased only through the Intercollegiate Athletics Ticket Office.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			Three ticket administrations are established within the integrated Penn State ticket system; the Arts Ticket Center, the Intercollegiate Athletics Ticket Office, and the Ticket Center at the Bryce Jordan Center. Each entity will be responsible for the ticket administration of events arranged by their respective organizations.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			The integrated Penn State ticket system is designed to allow all three entities to sell each others' tickets at their respective sales locations. The three ticket organizations will enter into agreements with each other to determine the method of operation and financial considerations to provide this service.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			All three ticketing services have the capability of providing counter, telephone, mail order, fax, and Internet sales. In addition, the Ticket Center at the Bryce Jordan Center has equipped outlets throughout central Pennsylvania to provide convenient sales locations to patrons. Convenience fees may apply to the customer for certain services to offset the cost of those services. These fees must be approved by the Corporate Controller.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			For individual events at their respective venue, each of the three ticketing services will be responsible for:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	li			Programming the ticket information onto the ticket system,
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	li			All accounting functions,
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	li			All ticket sellers at their location, and
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	li			Distribution of all pertinent information to the other ticketing services selling their tickets under the aforementioned agreements.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p	ol		All tickets selling for $5.00 and over will be subject to Regional County Impact fee as set forth by the University. Each Management shall so inform each user, sponsor, promoter, etc. as to the schedule of said fee at the time of requesting an event date. Such fee schedules shall be made available in writing upon request. The handling of this fee, whether to include it in the ticket price (absorb as overhead) or add it onto the ticket price (recoup the cost from the patron), will be determined by the designated facility administrator for each event.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			Users of the designated facilities must use the ticket service provided, or receive a written waiver from the designated facility administrator. If a waiver is given, the ticketing system will not be involved in any phase of ticketing (including the use of box offices at these Penn State facilities) for the event, and the user will be responsible for the entire ticket operation.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			If an event is to be presented at no charge to students and/or the public, the designated facility administrator reserves the right to require that tickets be issued by the user (or the ticket system). This procedure is to assist in matters of safety and crowd control.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad01	p			If, during review of any event, the designated facility administrator identifies a specific problem concerning tickets, a memo must be directed to the sponsor to specify the problem and suggest a solution (special ticket back-printing, supplemental hand-out, advertising, etc.).

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			PURPOSE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			A university is inherently a marketplace of ideas, and Penn State encourages and protects the rights of members of the University community to express divergent viewpoints and opinions on matters of concern. At the same time, the University encourages persons engaging in expressive activity to demonstrate civility, concern for the safety of persons and property, and respect for University activities and for those who may disagree with their message.  All persons engaging in expressive activity on University property must  comply with University policies. The purpose of this policy is to provide for expressive activity to be conducted on the grounds of the University in a manner consistent with these principles.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			This policy is applicable to University students, faculty, staff and others who wish to engage in speaking, literature distribution, poster or sign displays, petitioning and similar non commercial activities (generally referred to as expressive activity) at outdoor locations on University property. Use of University buildings and indoor facilities is addressed in other University policies. University grounds and buildings are reserved for use by students, faculty and staff, except as otherwise permitted by policies of the University. Questions concerning this policy should be directed to the Event Management Office, 125D HUB-Robeson Center.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			LOCATIONS FOR EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Based upon careful study, the following areas of the University Park Campus have been designated as areas suitable for expressive activity:

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Allen Street Gate Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Willard Building patio area between Willard and Obelisk
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Palmer Art Museum Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Northwest corner of Shortlidge Rd. and College Avenue
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Fisher Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			IST Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Pattee Library Mall entrance plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			HUB-Robeson - Rear sidewalk pad (not the Patio)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			HUB-Robeson - Lawn
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Osmond Fountain Area (after 5pm)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Area under the Willaman Gateway to the Life Sciences
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p	ul		At other University locations, the office of the Chancellor, Dean, or other administrator in charge should be consulted to identify the sites suitable for expressive activity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Groups should consider such factors as the number of people involved in the activity, how much space will be required, and the anticipated time and duration of the activity when selecting a location.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			RESERVATION OF LOCATION
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Registered student organizations, or a group of ten or more University students, faculty or staff, may reserve any one of the identified locations for the use of the group, subject to the following:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			All locations (except for Osmond Fountain) may be reserved between the hours of 8:00a.m. and 5:00p.m.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			There are selected areas that can be reserved for hours other than 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.. These are HUB Lawn, Old Main Patio and Fisher Plaza. These will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Events at these locations that incur costs from the University can only be reserved by registered student organizations or University Departments.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			A group may reserve only one location for each day.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			The same group may not reserve the same location for more than one day in each calendar week.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Reservation must be requested at least 48 hours in advance of the proposed activity, or by the Friday preceding a Sunday or Monday.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Reservations will be accepted in the order of request, unless considerations of format, size and equitable distribution of locations requires allocation of locations.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Reservation is voluntary but encouraged to avoid conflicts and insure availability.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			The group that has reserved the space has priority over non-reserved groups.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p	ul		Smaller groups and individuals are requested to voluntarily use the designated areas, but may use any outdoor area open to the public that can safely be used so long as noise levels do not conflict with the conduct of University business and crowds do not impede egress and ingress to University facilities.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			With a proper reservation, a group will have exclusive use of the reserved location and may not transfer the reservation to or allow use of the location by any other group. If a location has not been reserved, it will be available for use by a group, consistent with the other requirements of this policy. Registered student organizations and University groups will have absolute priority in the event of conflicting requests.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Registered student organizations, or a group of ten or more University students, faculty or staff, may reserve a location through The Event Management Office, 125D HUB-Robeson Center. Groups wishing to reserve a space other than those designated must submit a written request for an exception to this policy with the appropriate reservation office noted above.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			At non-University Park locations: registered student organizations, or groups of ten or more University students, faculty or staff should contact the Office of Student Affairs to reserve a location. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			NON-UNIVERSITY GROUPS
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Non-University groups requesting the use of University facilities may pick up the appropriate forms in the Event Management Office, 125 HUB-Robeson Center.

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	a			PURPOSE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	p			A university is inherently a marketplace of ideas, and Penn State encourages and protects the rights of members of the University community to express divergent viewpoints and opinions on matters of concern. At the same time, the University encourages persons engaging in expressive activity to demonstrate civility, concern for the safety of persons and property, and respect for University activities and for those who may disagree with their message.  All persons engaging in expressive activity on University property must  comply with University policies. The purpose of this policy is to provide for expressive activity to be conducted on the grounds of the University in a manner consistent with these principles.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	p			This policy is applicable to University students, faculty, staff and others who wish to engage in speaking, literature distribution, poster or sign displays, petitioning and similar non commercial activities (generally referred to as expressive activity) at outdoor locations on University property. Use of University buildings and indoor facilities is addressed in other University policies. University grounds and buildings are reserved for use by students, faculty and staff, except as otherwise permitted by policies of the University. Questions concerning this policy should be directed to the Event Management Office, 125D HUB-Robeson Center.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	a			LOCATIONS FOR EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	li			Area under the Willaman Gateway to the Life Sciences
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	p	ul		At other University locations, the office of the Chancellor, Dean, or other administrator in charge should be consulted to identify the sites suitable for expressive activity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	p			Groups should consider such factors as the number of people involved in the activity, how much space will be required, and the anticipated time and duration of the activity when selecting a location.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	a			RESERVATION OF LOCATION
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	p			Registered student organizations, or a group of ten or more University students, faculty or staff, may reserve any one of the identified locations for the use of the group, subject to the following:

These will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Events at these locations that incur costs from the University can only be reserved by registered student organizations or University Departments.

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad51	p			With a proper reservation, a group will have exclusive use of the reserved location and may not transfer the reservation to or allow use of the location by any other group. If a location has not been reserved, it will be available for use by a group, consistent with the other requirements of this policy. Registered student organizations and University groups will have absolute priority in the event of conflicting requests.

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			PURPOSE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	To establish the University's policy prohibiting sex and/or gender-based harassment and misconduct, as well as to define types of misconduct that must be reported. This policy is a companion to University Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			AD91
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			, Discrimination and Harassment and Related Inappropriate Conduct.  
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			POLICY STATEMENT
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			The University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons.  It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information or political ideas.  Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated. Gender-based and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, are forms of gender discrimination in that they deny or limit an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from University programs or activities.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			This policy shall not be construed to restrict academic freedom at the University, nor shall it be construed to restrict constitutionally protected expression.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Conduct prohibited by this policy may also violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other applicable federal and state laws. Chris Harris is the Title IX Coordinator.  Deputy Title IX Coordinators include Charmelle Green, Senior Associate Athletic Director of Intercollegiate Athletics and Kim Lantz Yoder, Equity Officer, Penn State College of Medicine.  Additional information about how to contact these individuals, or to otherwise pursue or report a violation of this Policy, is set forth below.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Pursuant to this policy and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the University will identify Responsible and Confidential Employees on a regular, ongoing basis, and notify these individuals of their obligations to report (or not report) potential violations.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			The University will provide regular, mandatory training for all University employees related to issues covered under this Policy.  All University employees will be required to complete Title IX training within the first 30 days of employment at the University.  In addition, all University employees will be required to complete an Annual Compliance Training as a reminder of reporting requirements and procedures on a yearly basis.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			CONDUCT THAT IS PROHIBITED BY THIS POLICY (“Prohibited Conduct”)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span			a. Sexual harassment is defined as follows:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University’s education program, activity, or employment. OR
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			When an employee of the University conditions the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct. OR
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			The conduct rises to the level of sexual assault, as defined in the Clery Act.  This can include any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the victims, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent.  It can also include the following:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em			i. Fondling
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p	ol		 - The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em			ii. Incest
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span	em		 - Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span			iii. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em	span		Statutory Rape
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span	em		 - Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span			iv. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em	span		Rape - 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span	em		The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			b. Gender-Based Harassment is behavior consisting of physical or verbal conduct based on gender, sexual orientation, gender-stereotyping, perceived gender, or gender identity, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, when such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it substantially interferes with an individual’s employment, education or ability to participate in or benefit from University programs, activities or opportunities and would detrimentally affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances.  Gender-Based Harassment may include, but is not limited to, verbal or physical attacks, graphic or written statements, threats, or slurs. Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited Gender-Based Harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs and the status of the individuals involved.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	(Note: Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	 defines Sex and/or Gender-based Discrimination as conduct of any nature that denies an individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of an individual’s employment, education, or living environment, because of the individual’s sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, pregnancy-related condition, gender, perceived gender, or gender identity. Conduct that may constitute Sex and/or Gender-based Discrimination but does not fall within the conduct defined in Policy AD85 is excluded from the definition of Prohibited Conduct in Policy AD85 and is addressed in Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			c. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sexual harassment and refers to sexual offenses including but not limited to rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual exploitation, sexual coercion and any other forms of nonconsensual sexual activity.  Sexual misconduct can be committed by strangers, acquaintances and family members, as well as casual and long-term dating partners.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Sexual assault occurs when a person engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a complainant without the victim’s consent, and includes rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape (as defined above). Sexual assault also includes, but is not limited to, attempted or unwanted sexual activity, such as sexual touching and fondling.  This includes the touching of an unwilling person’s intimate parts (defined as genitalia, groin, breast or buttock, or clothing covering them), or forcing an unwilling person to touch another’s intimate parts.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Sexual exploitation includes, but is not limited to: prostituting another person; non-consensual visual or audio recording of sexual activity; non-consensual display or distribution of photos, images or information of an individual’s sexual activity or intimate body parts; non-consensual voyeurism; coercing someone against their will to engage in sexual activity, or; knowingly transmitting sexually transmitted disease (STD) without disclosing STD status.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Consent must be informed, freely given and mutual.  If coercion, intimidation, threats or physical force are used there is no consent.  If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent. This includes impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol or drug consumption, or being asleep or unconscious, where the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was incapacitated.  Inducement of incapacitation of another with the intent to affect the ability of an individual to consent or refuse to consent to sexual contact almost always, if not always, negates consent.  Silence does not necessarily constitute consent.  Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over an alleged victim may be a factor in determining consent.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			d. Stalking is a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his/her safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional distress.  Stalking may include repeatedly following, harassing, threatening, or intimidating another by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device or method.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			e. Dating Violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim.  The existence of such a relationship will be based on the reporting party’s statement and with consideration of the length and type of relationship and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.  Dating violence includes but is not limited to sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse.  However, it is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of dating violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Domestic Violence includes crimes of violence committed against a victim by:  (i) a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; (ii) a person with whom the victim shares a child; (iii) a person who is or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse; (iv) a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim; or (v) any other person (adult or child) against whom the victim is protected under Pennsylvania’s domestic and family violence laws.  It is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of domestic violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	f. Retaliation, as defined in University Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			AD67
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			, is also prohibited by this policy and may subject the individual who retaliates in violation of this or other University policy to discipline or sanctions.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			In addition to the above, in the case of off-campus Prohibited Conduct that did not occur in the context of a University program or activity, the University will consider the effects of such off-campus conduct when evaluating whether there is a hostile environment on campus and/or in an off-campus education program or activity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			While not expressly prohibited, romantic and/or sexual relationships between faculty and students, staff and students or supervisors and subordinate employees are strongly discouraged.  Such relationships have the potential for adverse consequences, including the filing of charges of sexual harassment.  Given the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the relationship where one party has the power to give grades, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases or performance evaluations, the consensual nature of the relationship is inherently suspect.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Even when both parties have consented to the relationship, there may be perceptions of conflicts of interest or unfair treatment of others. Such perceptions undermine the atmosphere of trust essential to the educational process or the employment relationship. Accordingly, the person in the position of supervision or academic responsibility must promptly report the relationship to his or her immediate supervisor.  Once the consensual relationship is reported, the immediate supervisor is responsible for eliminating or mitigating the conflict of interest to the fullest feasible extent and ensuring that fair and objective processes are in place for decisions relative to grading, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases, or performance evaluations.  The new supervisory or academic arrangement should be documented.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			RESOURCES AND REPORTING
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			In situations involving danger to persons or property, individuals are strongly encouraged to first report the incident to the applicable police or public safety department.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			MANDATORY REPORTING
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			All Responsible Employees, as defined by this policy, are required to report Prohibited Conduct to the Title IX Coordinator as set forth below.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Confidential Employee – A University employee who is exempt from reporting to the Title IX Coordinator incidents of gender-based harassment, sexual violence, sexual harassment, or any other sexual misconduct in a way that identifies the victim. This includes professional and pastoral counselors and non-professional counselors or advocates. The University designates confidential employees and those individuals are notified of their designation.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Professional and pastoral counselors- includes licensed mental health counselors, pastors, priests, or any other pastoral counselor whose official responsibilities include providing mental health counseling to the campus community. It also includes individuals who are supervised by these people.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Non-professional counselors or advocates- includes individuals who are not professional or pastoral counselors, but work or volunteer in on-campus sexual assault centers, victim advocacy offices, women’s centers, or health centers, including front desk staff and students, social workers, doctors, medical staff, or any other person with a professional license requiring confidentiality.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p	ol		Employees who are designated as Confidential Employees are not required to report any information they learn about an incident involving Prohibited Conduct in a way that identifies the victim.  Some Confidential Employees, such as non-professional counselors or advocates, may be required to report aggregate data only.
