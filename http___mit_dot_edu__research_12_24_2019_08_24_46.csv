http://mit.edu//research	p		a	At MIT, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and possibility is our joyful obsession, and we celebrate fundamental discoveries and practical applications alike. As educators, we also value research as a potent form of 
http://mit.edu//research	a			learning by doing
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	. Through MITâs Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (
http://mit.edu//research	a			UROP
http://mit.edu//research	p			), more than 85% of undergraduates enrich their education through engaging in frontline, faculty-led research.
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	Research flourishes in our 30 departments across 
http://mit.edu//research	a			five schools
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	 and 
http://mit.edu//research	a			one college
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	, as well as in dozens of 
http://mit.edu//research	a			centers, labs, and programs
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	 that convene experts across disciplines to explore new intellectual frontiers and attack important societal problems. Our on-campus research capabilities are enhanced through the work of MIT 
http://mit.edu//research	a			Lincoln Laboratory
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	, the 
http://mit.edu//research	a			Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	, active research 
http://mit.edu//research	a			relationships with industry
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	, and a wide range of 
http://mit.edu//research	a			global collaborations
http://mit.edu//research	p		a	. In this work, the 
http://mit.edu//research	a			MIT Libraries
http://mit.edu//research	p			 serve as a crucial partner and a source of important research in their own right.
