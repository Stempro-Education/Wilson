http://www.kcad.edu/parents	p			KCAD is a small community where students don't fall through the cracks. Students know their peers and professors by name. With a 10:1 student/teacher ratio (one of the best in Michigan), your student's professors will know your son or daughter by name.  Since KCAD is student centered, you'll rarely find any graduate assistants teaching your student here. Our classes are taught by professors who are working artists that have both scholarly knowledge and real-world experience in the subjects they are teaching, giving them an edge in preparing students for the real world in art and design.
