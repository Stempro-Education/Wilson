https://alert.umd.edu	h1			            About UMD Alerts        
https://alert.umd.edu	p		u	The UMD Alerts System is a mass, urgent notification system, comprised of a variety of methods by which the University can notify 
https://alert.umd.edu	u			students, faculty and staff 
https://alert.umd.edu	p			of an active, major campus emergency:
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   Text messages (SMS) to mobile devices
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   Feed to Alertus Beacons
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   Early Warning Siren
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   Email (some email providers such as Yahoo may take up to 1 hour to deliver messages)
https://alert.umd.edu	p	ul	a	When the 
https://alert.umd.edu	a			University of Maryland Police Department
https://alert.umd.edu	p	ul		 determines there is an active emergency in which the public safety of the campus community may be at risk, an urgent notification through the UMD Alerts System will be initiated. Examples of when UMD Alerts will be activated include but are not limited to:
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   When a person is actively shooting a weapon on campus
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   When a tornado is predicted to strike the campus area
https://alert.umd.edu	li			   When a major hazardous material spill is impacting a large portion of campus
https://alert.umd.edu	p	ul		Localized incidents (such as a small fire, hazardous material spill in a lab, isolated criminal offense) likely would not require a mass notification.
https://alert.umd.edu	p			All UMD Students, faculty and staff members will be automatically registered to receive email notification to their email address associated with their UMD directory account. In order to receive UMD Alert SMS (text) messages, faculty, staff and students must register a mobile device number.

http://recwell.umd.edu	span			At UMD, my friends call me the ‘Intramural King.’ I’ve played on over 65 intramural sports teams with many fellow Terps who I call true friends of mine. Sharing the bond of being someone’s teammate creates long-lasting relationships off the field.
