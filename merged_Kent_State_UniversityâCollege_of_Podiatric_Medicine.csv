http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	h1			KSUCPM Goes Smoke Free, Tobacco Free as of July 1, 2017
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	div			Beginning July 1, 2017 smoking and tobacco use will not be allowed on any property owned, operated or leased by Kent State.  This includes personal vehicles parked on university property.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	div			All smoking is prohibited, including the use of electronic smoking devices, mod boxes or electronic nicotine delivery systems that create an aerosol or vapor.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	div			The policy also prohibits the use of nicotine, tobacco-derived or plant based products, and oral tobacco.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	div			Kent State will not advertise smoking or tobacco products on any university property or at any university-sponsored event.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	h3			LET'S CLEAR THE AIR
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p		a	Clearing the Air aligns with the priorities of the university’s healthy campus initiative, Kent State of Wellness. This initiative seeks to foster a culture of health and wellness for students and employees at all campuses and is part of the university’s 
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	a			Strategic Roadmap
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Tobacco smoke contains a deadly mix of more than 7,000 chemicals; hundreds are harmful, and about 70 can cause cancer.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			There are health benefits to quitting smoking at any age - it is never too late to quit.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Seven out of 10 adult smokers surveyed said they wanted to quit completely.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	h3	ul		THE POLICY
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			The policy covers all Kent State campuses, locations and properties, both domestic and international.  The policy applies to all members of the university community including:
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Students
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Employees
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Volunteers
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Vendors, contractors and others doing business on Kent State property
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Visitors to any Kent State campus or location.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	li			Customers on all Kent State property.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	strong			RESTRICTED PRODUCTS INCLUDE:
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	span	strong		 cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, cloves, hookahs, e-cigarettes, herbal and oil vaporizers, pipes, water pipes, all smokeless tobacco (chew, snuff, dip, etc.), and all other non-FDA approved nicotine products.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	h3			WHY IS KENT STATE BECOMING SMOKE- AND TOBACCO-FREE?
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			Kent State is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy learning, working and living environment for its students and employees. Clearing the air allows us to provide a context in which the entire Kent State community can be comfortable and productive.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	h3			ENFORCEMENT
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			Our goal is to achieve maximum voluntary compliance through communication about the smoke- and tobacco-free policy to our students, employees, and visitors. The success of this new policy will rely on the thoughtfulness, consideration and cooperation of smokers and nonsmokers alike. That being said, violation of the policy could result in disciplinary action:
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			Any student who repeatedly refuses to adhere to the policy may be referred to student conduct.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			Repeated violations by any Kent State employee will be handled through the normal employment procedures for violation of university procedures.
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			Visitors and others who are on campus and in violation of the policy should be reminded of the rule and asked to comply with it. 
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	h3			ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
http://www.kent.edu/node/605841	p			If you are a smoker and ready to kick the habit, Kent State can help by linking you to the many tobacco cessation resources available on our campuses and in the surrounding communities.  Check out the resource links in the navigation and get started on your way to a healthier lifestyle!
