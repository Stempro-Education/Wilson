http://post.edu/privacy-policy	strong		br	Definitions
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	strong			Cookies
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	hr		 Data created by a Web server that is stored on a user’s computer. It provides a way for the Web site to keep track of a user’s patterns and preferences and, with the cooperation of the Web browser, to store them on the user’s own hard disk.
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	p		The cookies contain a range of (Web addresses) for which they are valid. When the browser encounters those again, it sends those specific cookies to the Web server. For example, if a user’s ID were stored as a cookie, it would save that person from typing in the same information all over again when accessing that service for the second and subsequent time during the same browser session.
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	p		You can opt out of the use of cookies by having your browser disable cookies or warn you before accepting a cookie. Look for the cookie options in your browser in the Options or Preferences menu.
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	p		NOTE: If you disable cookies in your browser, you will not be able to access any of the University’s secured Web sites.
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	strong		br	IP (Internet Protocol) Address
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	p		 This is the address of a computer attached to a /IP network. Every client and server station must have a unique IP address. Client workstations have either a permanent address or one that is dynamically assigned for each dial-up session. IP addresses are written as four sets of numbers separated by periods; for example, 192.168.1.101.
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	strong		br	Browser Session
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	p		 A browser session is defined as the period of time a browser is in consecutive use. The session begins when you open the browser and ends when you close it. When you reopen the browser, you begin a new session.
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	strong		br	 Encryption (Secure Sockets Layer)
http://post.edu/privacy-policy	p	p		 The leading security protocol on the Internet. When an session is started, the browser sends its public key to the server so that the server can securely send a secret key to the browser. The browser and server exchange data via secret key encryption during that session. We also use encryption whenever we display your personal information (e.g., name and address, scheduled courses, grades).
