https://www.theamericancollege.edu/military	p		sup	Paul Henderson (Norfolk, VA) is an active duty Navy Lieutenant Commander currently stationed on aircraft carrier USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN 72). An Annapolis graduate, he spent several years as a helicopter pilot, which included a tour where he was hand-selected for an assignment with 5th Fleet in Bahrain. During this tour, he was able to sit in on high-level meetings chaired by then General James Mattis. He says, “I went into the Navy to fly, but I have stayed in because of the people and camaraderie.” During another tour, a tragic accident swept a fellow helo pilot overboard into the Red Sea. Seeing his shipmate’s wife struggle with no life insurance was one of the inspirations for him to begin laying the groundwork for a career in the life insurance profession. While he still has several years prior to his transition, he has already earned his life and health license and serves as the command financial specialist. He will be pursuing the Chartered Life Underwriter
