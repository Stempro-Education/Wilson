In addition, the office reviews University employment advertisements to insure that the University complies with appropriate guidelines and procedures, and proclaims that it is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer.
http://uni.edu/policies/1301	h3	p		IV. Establishment of Goals and Timetables
http://uni.edu/policies/1301	p	h3		A primary responsibility of the Office of Compliance and Equity Management is to assist departments in the development of plans to address the under-utilization of members of protected classes in the University. The Office of Compliance and Equity Management has the responsibility to collect and evaluate local, state, and national data to determine the factored availability of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities, and protected veterans and, in consultation with administrative officials, to determine unit goals, benchmarks and timetables for the achievement of those goals and benchmarks.

http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			All reports of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation shall be promptly made to the Title IX Officer (or designated Deputy Coordinator).
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	 The Assistant to the President for Compliance and Equity Management serves as the Title IX Officer and ADA/504 Coordinator and oversees implementation of the University’s Affirmative Action Plan and the University’s Policy on Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct. The designated Title IX Deputy Coordinator is the Senior Associate Athletic Director.  For those individuals who become aware of incidents involving discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct, reporting responsibilities are described in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section III 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	below.  A complainant’s options for reporting are addressed more specifically in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section IV
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	strong	 below.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			I.      Prohibited Conduct
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			A.    Discrimination
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The University of Northern Iowa adheres to all federal and state civil rights laws banning discrimination in public institutions of higher education. The University prohibits discrimination against any employee, applicant for employment, student or applicant for admission on the basis of any protected class. Protected classes include: age, color, creed, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, genetic information, marital status, national origin, political affiliation, pregnancy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran or military status, or any other protected category under applicable federal, state, or local law, including protections for those opposing discrimination or participating in any complaint process on campus or with other human rights agencies.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	strong	This policy covers discrimination in employment and in access to educational opportunities. Discrimination is defined as adverse treatment of an individual based on that individual’s membership in one or more of the protected groups listed above. Therefore, any member of the campus community, guest, or visitor who acts to deny, deprive, or limit the educational, employment, housing and/or social access, benefits, and/or opportunities of any member of the campus community on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in the protected classes listed above is in violation of the University policy on discrimination.  When brought to the attention of the University, any such 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		discrimination will be appropriately remedied by the University according to the procedures outlined in this policy.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			B.    Harassment
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	The University prohibits harassment against any employee, student, visitor, or guest on the basis of any class protected by University policy or law as identified in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section I.A
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	. above. This policy is not meant to inhibit or prohibit educational content or discussions inside or outside of the classroom that include germane but controversial or sensitive subject matters. The sections below describe the specific forms of prohibited harassment under University policy. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			1.    Bias-Related Harassment
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		This policy prohibits any form of harassment on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class, by any member or group of the campus community, which unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work or academic environment.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	This environment may be created by verbal, written, graphic, threatening and/or physical conduct that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive so as to interfere with, limit, or deny the ability of an individual to participate in or benefit from educational programs or activities or employment access, benefits, or opportunities. Merely offensive conduct and/or harassment of a generic nature not on the basis of membership in a protected class may not result in a violation of this policy but may be addressed through education and/or other resolution methods. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			2.    Sexual Harassment
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	This policy prohibits any form of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual- or gender-based verbal, written, online, and/or physical conduct. Anyone experiencing sexual harassment in any University program is encouraged to report it online, to the University’s Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator, or by methods identified in the Complaint Resolution Process Section (
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			IV.A. Confidentiality and Reporting of Offenses
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		). Sexual harassment creates a hostile environment and may be disciplined when it is sufficiently severe, pervasive, persistent, or objectively offensive that it:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			has the effect of unreasonably interfering with, denying, or limiting employment opportunities or the ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s educational, social, and/or residential program, or
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			is based on power differentials (quid pro quo), the creation of a hostile environment, or retaliation.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	blockquote		Some examples of possible sexual harassment include:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			A professor insists that a student have sex with the professor in exchange for a good grade. This is harassment regardless of whether the student complies with the request.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			A student repeatedly sends sexually oriented jokes on an e-mail list the student created, even when asked to stop, causing one recipient to avoid the sender on campus and in the residence hall in which they both live.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			Two supervisors frequently rate several employees’ bodies and sex appeal, commenting suggestively about their clothing and appearance.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			Consensual Relationships.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	blockquote	a	 Consensual romantic and/or sexual relationships where a power differential exists, whether real or perceived, may constitute sexual harassment. The effect of such a relationship may render an individual’s work, academic, or social environment intimidating, offensive, or hostile. Hence, all University employees are strongly discouraged from entering into romantic and/or sexual relationships which could lead to the creation of a hostile educational, social, and/or work environment for other members of the University community. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			3.    Sexual Misconduct
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		This policy prohibits any form of sexual misconduct. Acts of sexual misconduct may be committed by any person upon any other person, regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation, and/or gender identity of those involved. The definition of consent below will be used in the interpretation and application of this policy:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	em			Consent.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		 Consent is knowing, voluntary, and clear permission by word or action to engage in mutually agreed upon sexual activity. Since individuals may experience the same interaction in different ways, it is the responsibility of each party to make certain that the other has consented before engaging in the activity. For consent to be valid, there must be a clear expression in words or actions that the other individual consented to that specific sexual conduct. Consent to a specific sexual contact (such as kissing or fondling) cannot be presumed to be consent for another specific sexual activity (such as intercourse). A current or previous dating relationship is not sufficient to constitute consent. Silence or the absence of resistance alone is not consent. The existence of consent is based on the totality of the circumstances, including the context in which the alleged incident occurred. Individuals can withdraw consent at any time during sexual activity by expressing in words or actions that they no longer want the act to continue, and, if that happens, the other person must stop immediately.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		A person cannot consent if they are incapacitated. Under this policy, a person is incapacitated if they are disabled or deprived of ability to act or reason for one’s self, unable to understand what is happening, or disoriented, helpless, asleep, or unconscious for any reason, including due to alcohol or other drugs. Incapacitation is defined as a state where someone cannot make rational, reasonable decisions because they lack the capacity to give knowing consent (e.g., to understand the “who, what, when, where, why, or how” of their sexual interaction). This policy also covers a person whose incapacity results from mental disability, involuntary physical restraint, and/or from taking of an incapacitating substance. Under Iowa law, a person is incapacitated if the person is temporarily incapable of apprising or controlling the person’s own conduct due to the influence of a narcotic, anesthetic, or intoxicating substance; if a person is unable to communicate an unwillingness to act because the person is unconscious, asleep, or is otherwise physically limited; or if the person has a bodily impairment or handicap that substantially limits the person’s ability to resist or flee.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		An individual who engages in sexual activity when the individual knows, or should know, that the other person is physically or mentally incapacitated has violated this policy. It is not an excuse that the respondent to a claim of sexual misconduct was intoxicated and, therefore, did not realize the other person’s incapacity.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The following are types of prohibited sexual misconduct under this policy:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong		a	a.    Sexual Harassment (defined in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section I.B.2.

http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			the conduct does not fall within the definitions of sexual harassment, non-consensual sexual intercourse, or non-consensual sexual contact. Examples of sexual exploitation include, but are not limited to:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			sexual voyeurism (such as watching a person undressing, using the bathroom, or engaging in sexual acts without the consent of the person observed)
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			taking photographs, video recording, or audio recording of another in a sexual act or in any other private activity without the consent of all persons involved in the activity

http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			f.    Stalking
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			a course of conduct
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			directed at a specific person
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			that is unwelcome
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			and would cause a reasonable person to feel fear or suffer substantial emotional distress. Examples include, but are not limited to:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			sending multiple unwanted text messages, phone calls, or electronic communications
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span		a	following, watching, photographing, or otherwise tracking an individual without his or her permission
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			sending unwelcome gifts, notes, or other items to another person
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			  See 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span	a		 below for a definition of Stalking under Iowa law.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			C.    Retaliation
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The University seeks to create an environment where its students and employees are free, without fear of reprisal, to use its procedures to determine if there has been a violation of their civil rights. Any act of retaliation will result in appropriate disciplinary action.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Retaliation is defined as any adverse action taken against a person participating in a protected activity because of their participation in that protected activity. Retaliation against an individual for alleging a violation of their civil rights, supporting a complainant, or for assisting in providing information relevant to a claim, is a serious violation of the this policy. Acts of alleged retaliation should be reported immediately to the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator.  For other acts of alleged retaliation, see 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Policy 13.19 Retaliation and Misconduct Reporting.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			D.    Other Offenses
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		This policy prohibits other offenses of a discriminatory, harassing, and/or retaliatory nature not included in the previous sections as follows:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Intimidation, defined as implied threats or acts that cause a reasonable fear of harm in another on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Hazing, defined under this policy as acts likely to cause physical or psychological harm or social ostracism to any person within the University community when related to the admission, initiation, pledging, joining, or any other group-affiliation activity on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class. See 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section VIII.C.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span	a		 below for a definition of Hazing under Iowa law.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Bullying, defined under this policy as repeated and/or severe aggressive behavior likely to intimidate or intentionally hurt, control or diminish another person, physically or mentally on the basis of actual or perceived membership in a protected class. See 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span	a		 below for a definition of Bullying under Iowa law.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Violation of any other University rule, when it is motivated by sex or gender or the actual or perceived membership of the victim in a protected class, may be pursued using this policy and process.   
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			II.      Jurisdiction/Application
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		This policy applies to allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that take place on UNI property or at university-sponsored events, regardless of their location. This policy may also apply to allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation that occur off-campus or to actions online when the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator determines that the off-campus or online conduct could have an on-campus impact or impact on the educational mission of the University. Such impact includes:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Any action that constitutes a criminal offense as defined by federal, state, or local law;
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Any situation where it appears that the respondent may present a danger or threat to the health or safety of self or others;
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Any situation that significantly impinges upon the rights, property, or achievements of others or significantly breaches the peace and/or causes social disorder; and/or
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	span			Any situation that is detrimental to the educational interests of the University.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	ul	a	The University’s response may be limited if the respondent was a guest or is not subject to the University’s jurisdiction. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			III.     Reporting Responsibilities
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		It is imperative that supervisors set the tone for the enforcement of this policy. Supervisory employees who are aware of or witness discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation are required to promptly report to the Title IX Officer or Title IX Deputy Coordinator. Non-supervisory employees who are aware of or witness discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation involving students are required to promptly report to the Title IX Officer or Title IX Deputy Coordinator. Any student who is aware of or who witnesses discrimination, harassment, sexual misconduct, or retaliation is encouraged to promptly report to the Title IX Officer or Title IX Deputy Coordinator. Students who are employed by the University are considered non-supervisory employees for purposes of this policy while acting in the capacity of their University employment. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		All initial contacts will be treated with the maximum possible privacy: specific information on any complaint received by any party will be reported to the Title IX Officer, but, subject to the University’s obligation to investigate and redress violations, every reasonable effort will be made to maintain the privacy of those initiating a report or a complaint. In all cases, the University will give consideration to the complainant with respect to how the complaint is pursued but reserves the right, when necessary to protect the community, to investigate and pursue a resolution when an alleged victim chooses not to initiate or participate in a formal complaint.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator will also accept anonymous reports. Anonymous reporting will fulfill employees' required reporting responsibilities. Nothing in this policy will infringe upon the rights of employees to engage in concerted activities as guaranteed by Iowa Code 20.8(3). 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Please note:  This section addresses reporting obligations for members of our campus community who are made aware of potential violations of this policy.  Methods for filing a complaint and the Complaint Resolution Process are detailed in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section IV.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	  Additional resource-related information can be found in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	In addition, certain employees, known as Campus Security Authorities (CSA), have a legal obligation to file a report with the University Police concerning suspected criminal activity to meet the requirements of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act). Additional information is available at the 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Public Safety CSA website
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			A.    Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		University Title IX Officer:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	br	Leah Gutknecht, Assistant to the President for Compliance and Equity Management 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	117 Gilchrist Hall, 319.273.2846, 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			leah.gutknecht@uni.edu
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Title IX Deputy Coordinator:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	br	Christina Roybal, Senior Associate Athletic Director 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	310 UNI-Dome, 319.273.2556, 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			christina.roybal@uni.edu
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			B.    Role of the Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator are charged with coordinating the University response to reports of misconduct under this policy. The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator do not serve as advocates for either the complainant or the respondent. The Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator will explain to both parties the informal and formal processes outlined below and the provisions for confidentiality. Where appropriate, the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator will provide to both parties information on options for obtaining advocacy, medical and counseling services, and making criminal reports, and will assist with providing information on other resources. The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator will coordinate with other campus officials to take appropriate interim actions such as no contact orders, academic accommodations, and rearrangement of housing, dining, and work assignments. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			C.    Police Reporting
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		In addition to required campus reporting, reports may also be made to the police, especially if a crime is or may be involved, by calling the following numbers:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	br	Emergency 9-1-1 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	br	UNI Police, 30 Gilchrist Hall, 319.273.2712 (on-campus incidents) 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Cedar Falls/Waterloo Police, 319.291.2515 (off-campus incidents) 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			D.    Federal Timely Warning Obligations
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Victims of sexual misconduct should be aware that University administrators must issue crime alerts for incidents reported to them that represent a serious or continuing threat to students or employees. The University will withhold a victim’s name and other identifying information while providing enough information for community members to make safety decisions in light of the potential danger. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			IV.    Complaint Resolution Process
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	The University will respond to any alleged violation of this policy received by the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator.  This section outlines ways in which offenses 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	can be reported by individuals choosing to pursue complaint options.  Additional resource-related information can be found in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section VIII 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	and at 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			A.    Confidentiality and Reporting of Offenses
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The University of Northern Iowa will make every effort to safeguard the identities of individuals who seek help and/or report discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation. While steps are taken to protect the privacy of victims, the University may need to investigate an incident and take action once an allegation is known, whether or not the reporting individual chooses to pursue a complaint.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		When a report is made, personally identifiable information (name of victim, name of respondent, etc.) may be initially withheld at the victim's request. The University Title IX Officer will conduct an initial inquiry, looking for any sign of pattern, predation, violence, or threat. In circumstances involving serious danger to members of the community, the Title IX Officer may request additional information in an effort to ensure campus safety.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	No employee should ever promise absolute confidentiality except those as described below in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section IV.A.2
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	.  Reports may be private, but not confidential, as described below in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section IV.A.3
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		.  Reports to police and/or Title IX officials do not obligate the complainant to file any criminal or university conduct charges.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	The University will not pursue disciplinary action for improper use of alcohol or other drugs against an alleged victim of sexual misconduct or against another student who shares information as either a witness to or as a reporter of sexual misconduct as long as the report is made in good faith. See “Good Samaritan Provision,” Article III(4), 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Student Conduct Code
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Deliberately false and/or malicious accusations of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, as opposed to complaints which, even if erroneous, are made in good faith, are just as serious an offense as discrimination, harassment, or retaliation and will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			Complaints and reports should be made as soon as possible after an incident
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	. Information and resources are available through the 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			UNI Safety page
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	. Options for filing a report include: 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			1.    Anonymous and Third Party Reporting
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	The Title IX Officer and Deputy Coordinator accept anonymous and third-party reports of conduct alleged to violate this policy and will follow up on such reports. The individual making the report is encouraged to provide as much detailed information as possible to allow the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator to investigate and respond as appropriate. The University may be limited in its ability to investigate an anonymous or third party report unless sufficient information is provided.  (See 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	 to file a report or complaint.) 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			2.    Confidential Reporting
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	If a reporting party would like the details of an incident to be kept confidential, the reporting party may speak with counselors, health service providers, victim services advocates, domestic violence resources, local or state assistance agencies, or members of the clergy who are permitted by law to maintain confidentiality (except in extreme cases of immediacy of threat or danger or abuse of a minor). These sources will submit anonymous statistical information for timely warning and Clery Act purposes. If a reporting party is unsure of a resource’s ability to maintain confidentiality, the reporting party is advised to ask them before talking to them. See 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		 for additional information on these resources.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			UNI counselors
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	 for students and/or the 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Employee Assistance Program
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	 for employees are available to help free of charge and can be seen on an emergency basis. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			3.    Private Reporting
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Reports to University employees who are not confidential resources listed above in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section IV.A.2.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	 will be treated with the maximum possible privacy. If a reporting party is unsure of a resource’s ability to maintain privacy, the reporting party is advised to ask them before talking to them. The resource will be able to explain the resource’s reporting obligations and help a reporting party make decisions about who is in the best position to help. If personally identifiable information is shared, it will be shared with as few people as possible under the circumstances and efforts will be made to protect privacy to the greatest extent reasonably possible. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			4.    Formal Reporting
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Complainants are encouraged to speak to University officials, such as the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator or UNI Police, to make formal reports. Complainants have the right, and can expect, to have complaints taken seriously by the University when formally reported and to have those incidents investigated and properly resolved through these procedures. Formal reporting still affords privacy to the reporter and only a small group of officials who need to know will be told. Information will be shared as necessary with investigator(s), witnesses, and the respondent. The number of people with this knowledge will be kept as low as reasonably possible to preserve a complainant’s rights and privacy. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			5.    Criminal Reporting
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	If someone is in immediate danger or is a victim of a crime, call 9-1-1. Some acts of discrimination and harassment may also be crimes, such as sexual assault or stalking. Allegations of criminal conduct should be reported to law enforcement even when it is not clear whether the conduct rises to the level of a crime. Regardless, law enforcement can assist with obtaining medical care, getting immediate law enforcement response and protection, connecting with victim advocate services and counseling support, initiating a criminal investigation as appropriate, and answering questions about the criminal process. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			B.    Informal Resolution Process
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Informal resolution is an alternative to the formal complaint resolution process. The Title IX Officer will determine if informal resolution is appropriate, based on the willingness of the parties and the nature of the alleged conduct. Sanctions are generally not pursued as the result of an informal resolution process, though the parties may agree to appropriate remedies. The Title IX Officer will keep records of any resolution that is reached. The University reserves the right to cancel informal resolution if sufficient evidence suggests a formal investigation or other sanctions or remedies may be necessary and appropriate.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		It is not necessary to pursue informal resolution first in order to make a formal complaint, and anyone participating in informal resolution can stop that process at any time and request to continue through the formal process.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Except in cases involving criminal activity and/or sexual assault, an employee or student alleging discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation against an employee under this policy is encouraged to discuss the allegation with the head of the department in which the alleged discrimination, harassment and/or retaliation occurred. The department head will then consult with the Office of Compliance and Equity Management to determine an appropriate course of action. If it is appropriate, an attempt to facilitate an informal resolution of the matter will be made. In the event that an informal resolution is not reached, is not appropriate, or is not pursued, the student or employee who is alleging the discrimination, harassment, or retaliation may consult with the Office of Compliance and Equity Management to initiate a formal investigation. If, at any time, the employee or student is not comfortable addressing the department head, the Office of Compliance and Equity Management may be contacted directly.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Note: If an allegation includes actions that involve criminal activity and/or sexual assault, reports will be coordinated by the Title IX Officer. Individuals are strongly encouraged to also file a report with UNI Police. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			C.    Formal Resolution Process
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			1.    Filing a Complaint
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Any individual who believes that this policy has been violated should contact the Title IX Officer or Title IX Deputy Coordinator. The University website also includes a reporting form at 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		 which may serve to initiate a complaint.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			a. Complaint Intake
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Following receipt of notice or a complaint, the Title IX Officer or Deputy Coordinator will normally, within four business days, make an initial determination as to whether the information has merit to reasonably indicate there may have been a violation of University policy. If it appears a violation may have occurred, an investigation will begin. If the complaint does not appear to allege a policy violation or if conflict resolution is desired by the complainant and appears appropriate given the nature of the alleged behavior, then the complaint does not proceed to investigation. An investigation will be pursued if there is sufficient information to suggest a policy violation may exist, a pattern of misconduct, and/or a perceived threat of further harm to the community or any of its members. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			b. Interim Action
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The University will implement interim and/or protective actions upon notice of alleged discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation and will take additional prompt remedial and/or disciplinary action with respect to any member of the community, guest, or visitor who has violated this policy.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Interim actions include but are not limited to: no contact orders, no trespass notices, providing counseling and/or medical services, academic support, living arrangement adjustments, providing a campus escort, academic or work schedule and assignment accommodations, safety planning, and referral to campus and community resources.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		The University may suspend, on an interim basis, a student or student organization or place an employee on administrative leave pending the completion of the investigation and procedures. In cases in which an interim suspension or administrative leave is imposed, the student, employee, or student organization will be given the opportunity to meet with an appropriate administrator prior to such action being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, to show cause why the action should not be implemented. Violation of interim provisions will be grounds for disciplinary action.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	During an interim suspension or administrative leave, a student or employee may be denied access to University housing and/or the University campus, facilities, or events, either entirely or with specific application. As determined by the appropriate administrative officer, this restriction includes classes and/or all other University activities or privileges for which the individual might otherwise be eligible. At the discretion of the appropriate administrative officer, alternative coursework options may be pursued to ensure as minimal an impact as possible on the respondent student. At the discretion of the appropriate administrative officer, alternative employment/work options may be pursued to ensure as minimal an impact as possible on the respondent employee. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			2.    Notice of Charges
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Once an investigator has been assigned, written notice of the allegations will be provided to the parties involved. If the respondent is an employee, the written notice will be copied to the employee’s department head/director, dean, vice president, and president. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			3.    Investigation
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		If a complainant wishes to pursue a formal complaint or if the University determines an investigation is necessary, the Title IX Officer will assign an investigator, usually within two business days of determining that a complaint should proceed. Investigations will be thorough and impartial and will entail interviews with relevant parties and witnesses, and obtaining available evidence. The University aims to complete investigations within 60 days, which can be extended as necessary for appropriate cause by the Title IX Officer with notice to the parties. Investigation may take longer when initial complaints fail to provide direct first-hand information. The University may undertake a short delay (usually 3-10 days, to allow evidence collection) when criminal charges are being investigated. University action will continue regardless of the status of civil or criminal charges involving the same incident.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			a. Student Withdrawal While Charges Pending
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Should a responding student decide to withdraw from the University and/or not participate in the investigation and/or hearing, the process will nonetheless proceed in the student’s absence to a reasonable resolution and that student will not be permitted to return to the University unless any and all sanctions have been satisfied. The Title IX Officer will continue to act to promptly and effectively remedy the effects of the conduct upon the victim and the community.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			b. Employee Resignation While Charges Pending
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Should a responding employee resign while charges are pending, the records of the Title IX Officer will reflect that status, as will University responses to any future inquiries regarding employment references for that individual. Should an employee decide to leave and not participate in the investigation and/or hearing, the process will nonetheless proceed in the employee’s absence to a reasonable resolution and that employee will not be permitted to return to the University unless any and all sanctions have been satisfied. The Title IX Officer will continue to act to promptly and effectively remedy the effects of the conduct upon the victim and the community. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			4.    Investigation Findings
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			a.    For Students
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Upon receipt of the investigative report, the Title IX Officer will forward it to both parties and the Dean of Students or designee for an appropriate hearing per Student Conduct Code procedures. Following the hearing, if applicable, the decision of whether a policy violation has occurred will be determined by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. A finding of a policy violation by a preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the policy violation occurred. If, following the hearing, the decision is that no policy violation has occurred the process will end. Regardless of the outcome, the complainant, the respondent, and the Title IX Officer will be notified of the finding in writing.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		If, following a hearing, the student is found to have violated University policy, appropriate disciplinary sanctions will be determined after consultation with the Title IX Officer. The Dean of Students (or designee) will notify the respondent, the complainant, and the Title IX Officer in writing of the Dean of Students’ decision. This written decision must be issued within fifteen working days of the date of receipt of the investigative report from the Title IX Officer.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			b.    For Employees
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Upon receipt of the investigative report, the Title IX Officer will determine if this policy has been violated by using a preponderance of the evidence standard. A finding of a policy violation by a preponderance of the evidence means that it is more likely than not that the policy violation occurred. If the Title IX Officer decides that no policy violation has occurred, then the process will end. Regardless of the outcome, the complainant and the respondent will be notified of the finding in writing. The respondent’s department head/director, Dean, Vice President, and the President will also be notified of the finding.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	In the event that the employee violated University policy, the Vice President of the respondent will determine appropriate disciplinary sanctions based on the recommendation from the Title IX Officer. Regardless of the outcome, the complainant, the respondent, and the Title IX Officer will be notified in writing of the outcome within fifteen working days of the date of the notice from the Title IX Officer. If the Vice President serves as a party or witness in the investigation, the Title IX Officer’s recommendation will be sent to the President for determination of disciplinary sanctions. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			5.    Sanctions
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	Sanctions will be recommended by the Title IX Officer and forwarded to the decision-making authority as noted above in

http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Appeals of the decision of the Dean of Students (for students) or the Vice President/President (for employees) may be filed by the complainant or the respondent or both. All requests for appeal considerations must be submitted in writing to the Title IX Officer within five business days of the date of the final written notice.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Appeals are limited to allegations of the following:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			A procedural error or omission occurred that significantly impacted the outcome.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			There is new evidence, unknown or unavailable during the investigation, that could substantially impact the finding or sanction. A summary of this new evidence and its potential impact upon the investigation must be included in the appeal.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			The sanctions imposed are substantially disproportionate to the severity of the violation.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	blockquote		The original finding and sanction/responsive actions will stand if the appeal is not timely or is not based on the grounds listed above, and such a finding and sanction/responsive action(s) are final. When a party requests an appeal, the other party (parties) will be notified and given an opportunity to respond.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		For students:  In cases involving student conduct, a person designated by the Vice President for Student Affairs will review the appeal request(s).
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		For employees:  In cases involving employee conduct, a person designated by the President will review the appeal request(s).
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		Where the designee finds that at least one of the grounds is met, and proceeds with the appeal, additional principles governing the hearing of appeals include the following:
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			The original decision will only be changed when there is a compelling justification to do so.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			Appeals are not intended to be full re-hearings of the complaint. Appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation or record of the original hearing and pertinent documentation regarding the grounds for appeal.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			Sanctions will not be imposed pending the outcome of the appeal. Interim and/or protective actions may be imposed and/or continued as appropriate.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			The designee will render a decision within ten business days to the Title IX Officer who will normally provide written notice of the appeal to all parties within two to three business days from the date of the appeal review.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p			All parties should be informed of whether the grounds for an appeal are accepted and the results of the appeal decision.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p		a	Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final: further appeals are not permitted under this policy. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			7.    Failure to Complete Sanctions
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	All respondents are expected to comply with conduct sanctions within the time frame specified in their written notice. Failure to follow through on conduct sanctions by the date specified, whether by refusal, neglect, or any other reason, may result in additional sanctions and/or suspension, expulsion, and/or termination from the University. For students, failure to comply may result in transcript notation and/or a hold to prevent future registration. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			V.    Remedial Actions
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	In addition to the interim actions outlined in 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	a			Section IV.C.1.b
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p		, the Title IX Officer (or designee) may provide remedial actions intended to address the short or long-term effects of harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation. That is, remedial actions may be taken at the conclusion of the process in addition to any actions that may have been taken on an interim basis, in order to redress harm to the complainant and the community and to prevent further harassment or violations. Remedial actions may also be used when, in the judgment of the Title IX Officer (or designee), the safety or well-being of any member(s) of the campus community may be jeopardized by the presence on campus of the respondent or the ongoing activity of a student organization whose behavior is in question.
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	p	p	a	These remedies may include referral to counseling and health services or to the Employee Assistance Program, education to the community, altering the housing situation of a respondent student or resident employee (or the alleged complainant, if desired), altering work arrangements, providing campus escorts, implementing contact limitations between the parties, or offering adjustments to academic deadlines and/or course schedules. 
http://uni.edu/policies/1302	strong			VI. Statement of Rights for Complainants and Respondents
