http://www.tlsohio.edu	p			An institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church  in America, Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital  University is committed to expanding its students'  discernment of faith, responsibility to one another  and purposeful impact. That's forming leaders for  Christ's church at work in the world.
http://www.tlsohio.edu	b			Beyond the Books
http://www.tlsohio.edu	p			A theological seminary is more than an educational institution. It is also a community of Christians gathering in the name of Jesus to praise God and to be empowered for mission. A seminary education involves seeking the maximum possible involvement in the various dimensions of the entire experience: academics, common meals, worship, ministry in context, community life and special programs.
http://www.tlsohio.edu	h2			Message from the Dean
http://www.tlsohio.edu	h4			I BELIEVE THE HEART OF THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IS FORMING FAITHFUL, WISE AND COURAGEOUS LEADERS TO WITNESS TO THE GOOD NEWS OF JESUS CHRIST IN WORD AND ACTION.
http://www.tlsohio.edu	p			The church is called to be a servant-witness in the world. That requires leaders who are formed in faith, informed by knowledge, and experienced in practical application of their learning. As the world around us changes, church leaders need to be able to speak the Gospel in new ways to new audiences in new contexts.
http://www.tlsohio.edu	p			Whether you are a prospective student discerning a call to ministry or to further theological study, an alumnus or alumna eager to see your alma mater continue preparing strong leaders for the church’s work in the world, or a friend interested in supporting this mission with your financial gifts, we are grateful to be in relationship with you. In the words of hymn writer Richard Leach, ‘Come, join the dance of Trinity!’

http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	p			An institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church  in America, Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital  University is committed to expanding its students'  discernment of faith, responsibility to one another  and purposeful impact. That's forming leaders for  Christ's church at work in the world.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	b			Beyond the Books
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	p			A theological seminary is more than an educational institution. It is also a community of Christians gathering in the name of Jesus to praise God and to be empowered for mission. A seminary education involves seeking the maximum possible involvement in the various dimensions of the entire experience: academics, common meals, worship, ministry in context, community life and special programs.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	h2			Message from the Dean
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	h4			I BELIEVE THE HEART OF THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IS FORMING FAITHFUL, WISE AND COURAGEOUS LEADERS TO WITNESS TO THE GOOD NEWS OF JESUS CHRIST IN WORD AND ACTION.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	p			The church is called to be a servant-witness in the world. That requires leaders who are formed in faith, informed by knowledge, and experienced in practical application of their learning. As the world around us changes, church leaders need to be able to speak the Gospel in new ways to new audiences in new contexts.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	p			Whether you are a prospective student discerning a call to ministry or to further theological study, an alumnus or alumna eager to see your alma mater continue preparing strong leaders for the church’s work in the world, or a friend interested in supporting this mission with your financial gifts, we are grateful to be in relationship with you. In the words of hymn writer Richard Leach, ‘Come, join the dance of Trinity!’
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Arts	b			The Rev. Kathryn A. Kleinhans, Ph.D.

http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	p			An institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church  in America, Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital  University is committed to expanding its students'  discernment of faith, responsibility to one another  and purposeful impact. That's forming leaders for  Christ's church at work in the world.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	b			Beyond the Books
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	p			A theological seminary is more than an educational institution. It is also a community of Christians gathering in the name of Jesus to praise God and to be empowered for mission. A seminary education involves seeking the maximum possible involvement in the various dimensions of the entire experience: academics, common meals, worship, ministry in context, community life and special programs.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	h2			Message from the Dean
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	h4			I BELIEVE THE HEART OF THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IS FORMING FAITHFUL, WISE AND COURAGEOUS LEADERS TO WITNESS TO THE GOOD NEWS OF JESUS CHRIST IN WORD AND ACTION.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	p			The church is called to be a servant-witness in the world. That requires leaders who are formed in faith, informed by knowledge, and experienced in practical application of their learning. As the world around us changes, church leaders need to be able to speak the Gospel in new ways to new audiences in new contexts.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	p			Whether you are a prospective student discerning a call to ministry or to further theological study, an alumnus or alumna eager to see your alma mater continue preparing strong leaders for the church’s work in the world, or a friend interested in supporting this mission with your financial gifts, we are grateful to be in relationship with you. In the words of hymn writer Richard Leach, ‘Come, join the dance of Trinity!’
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Art	b			The Rev. Kathryn A. Kleinhans, Ph.D.

http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	p			An institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church  in America, Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital  University is committed to expanding its students'  discernment of faith, responsibility to one another  and purposeful impact. That's forming leaders for  Christ's church at work in the world.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	b			Beyond the Books
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	p			A theological seminary is more than an educational institution. It is also a community of Christians gathering in the name of Jesus to praise God and to be empowered for mission. A seminary education involves seeking the maximum possible involvement in the various dimensions of the entire experience: academics, common meals, worship, ministry in context, community life and special programs.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	h2			Message from the Dean
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	h4			I BELIEVE THE HEART OF THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IS FORMING FAITHFUL, WISE AND COURAGEOUS LEADERS TO WITNESS TO THE GOOD NEWS OF JESUS CHRIST IN WORD AND ACTION.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	p			The church is called to be a servant-witness in the world. That requires leaders who are formed in faith, informed by knowledge, and experienced in practical application of their learning. As the world around us changes, church leaders need to be able to speak the Gospel in new ways to new audiences in new contexts.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	p			Whether you are a prospective student discerning a call to ministry or to further theological study, an alumnus or alumna eager to see your alma mater continue preparing strong leaders for the church’s work in the world, or a friend interested in supporting this mission with your financial gifts, we are grateful to be in relationship with you. In the words of hymn writer Richard Leach, ‘Come, join the dance of Trinity!’
http://www.tlsohio.edu/RA	b			The Rev. Kathryn A. Kleinhans, Ph.D.

http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	p			An institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Church  in America, Trinity Lutheran Seminary at Capital  University is committed to expanding its students'  discernment of faith, responsibility to one another  and purposeful impact. That's forming leaders for  Christ's church at work in the world.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	b			Beyond the Books
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	p			A theological seminary is more than an educational institution. It is also a community of Christians gathering in the name of Jesus to praise God and to be empowered for mission. A seminary education involves seeking the maximum possible involvement in the various dimensions of the entire experience: academics, common meals, worship, ministry in context, community life and special programs.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	h2			Message from the Dean
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	h4			I BELIEVE THE HEART OF THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION IS FORMING FAITHFUL, WISE AND COURAGEOUS LEADERS TO WITNESS TO THE GOOD NEWS OF JESUS CHRIST IN WORD AND ACTION.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	p			The church is called to be a servant-witness in the world. That requires leaders who are formed in faith, informed by knowledge, and experienced in practical application of their learning. As the world around us changes, church leaders need to be able to speak the Gospel in new ways to new audiences in new contexts.
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	p			Whether you are a prospective student discerning a call to ministry or to further theological study, an alumnus or alumna eager to see your alma mater continue preparing strong leaders for the church’s work in the world, or a friend interested in supporting this mission with your financial gifts, we are grateful to be in relationship with you. In the words of hymn writer Richard Leach, ‘Come, join the dance of Trinity!’
http://www.tlsohio.edu/Service	b			The Rev. Kathryn A. Kleinhans, Ph.D.
