http://www.caltech.edu	p			Nayla Abney took a chance leaving New Jersey and the East Coast to come to Caltech. She helped launch the inaugural season for women's soccer at Caltech in 2017 and says the sport and the team teach lessons that help her in the classroom and on the field. The chemical engineering major is inspired by the researchers and professors on campus, and she is committed to building a legacy for other young women at Caltech.

http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply	p			It's no secret that admission to Caltech is selective; we welcome only about 230 new freshmen and 10 to 15 new transfer students to campus each fall. These students come to Caltech from all over the United States—and the world—bringing with them diverse experiences, perspectives, and passions.
http://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply	p	p		Hoping to be among next year's undergraduate class? All we ask is that you share the typical Caltech student's unbridled sense of curiosity and extraordinary aptitude for and interest in science, engineering, and technology.
