http://www.clarksoncollege.edu	p			Clarkson College has not always been a college. Instead, we began in 1888 as a school of nursing—the first in the state of Nebraska. Over the last 125 years, we've established a new campus, expanded our program offerings and adopted a new name. All the while, we've maintained a commitment to preparing our students to be the best in various realms of health care. This commitment to excellence has and always will remain a defining quality of Clarkson College.

http://www.clarksoncollege.edu/about	h2			Since 1888
http://www.clarksoncollege.edu/about	p			Clarkson College was founded in 1888 as Bishop Clarkson Memorial Hospital School of Nursing, just blocks away from its present-day campus in Omaha, Neb. The continual increase in enrollment caused a need to relocate to a larger campus. This shift sparked various other transformations, and what was once the first school of nursing in the state of Nebraska is now one of the most thriving allied health care colleges in the region.
