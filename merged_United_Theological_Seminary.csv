https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			LIVE Classroom
https://united.edu/live-classroom	h3			Seminary Education.  Without Relocation.
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			Have you ever wished you could attend seminary, but personal obligations prohibit you from relocating? Perhaps you are serving in ministry or cannot uproot your family, but you are compelled to answer a call from God. Now, you can participate in on-campus courses from your own home or office.
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			United’s Live Interactive Virtual Education (LIVE) enables students to gain a seminary education, without relocation. LIVE offers a number of potential benefits:
https://united.edu/live-classroom	strong			Real-time engagement: 
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			Distance students participate in on-campus courses via webcam, engaging in live lectures and discussion with faculty and other students. Students in the LIVE environment spend more time in interactive dialog and less time on forum posts.
https://united.edu/live-classroom	strong			Diverse learning community: 
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			On-campus students may converse with distance students from around the country, enriching the learning experience with diverse denominational, cultural, and global perspectives.
https://united.edu/live-classroom	strong			Structured learning:
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			 For those who want to pursue online learning but desire more structure, the LIVE learning model features a regular pace of scheduled meeting times, as in on-campus courses.
https://united.edu/live-classroom	strong			Deeper relationships:
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			 Students have the opportunity to get to know faculty members and students from across the country in the LIVE learning environment, while building tight-knit relationships that can last a lifetime.
https://united.edu/live-classroom	strong			Minimal travel:
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p		a	 Combining LIVE, 
https://united.edu/live-classroom	a			online
https://united.edu/live-classroom	p			, hybrid and intensive courses, United offers flexible degree plans that enable students to gain a Master of Divinity with as few as two weeks on campus, a Master of Arts in Christian Ministries or Master of Ministry with as few as one week on campus, a Master of Theological Studies or a Master of Arts fully online.*
https://united.edu/live-classroom	i		em	Residency requirements may vary by denomination. Most United Methodist students must complete 1/3 of their degree on campus. 
https://united.edu/live-classroom	em			The primarily online MDiv is offered as an approved exception to ATS Degree Program Standard A, section A.3.1.3. The primarily online MACM and MMin are offered as an approved exception to ATS Degree Program Standard B, section B.3.1.3.

https://united.edu/our-chapel	p			Our Chapel
https://united.edu/our-chapel	p		b	One of United’s three core commitments is 
https://united.edu/our-chapel	b			The Cultivation of Holiness
https://united.edu/our-chapel	p			. We believe in the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit in worship, who helps us to become the people God created us to be.
https://united.edu/our-chapel	b			The Richard A. and Nancy Zimmerman Chapel
https://united.edu/our-chapel	p			On October 11, 20116, United Theological Seminary dedicated the Richard A. and Nancy Zimmerman Chapel, a new permanent worship space. For 20 years, Mr. Zimmerman was a member of United’s Board of Trustees, acting as Chair of the Board for eight of those years. Mr. Zimmerman served as CEO of The Hershey Company in Hershey, Pennsylvania, for many years. When he passed away in 2014, Mr. Zimmerman left a legacy of worship through a generous bequest to provide a permanent chapel at United. Mrs. Zimmerman has devoted additional funds to the project to ensure that the worship space will be best suited to the needs of the seminary, both now and in the future.
https://united.edu/our-chapel	b			Architectural Elements of the Zimmerman Chapel:
https://united.edu/our-chapel	b			The Cross
https://united.edu/our-chapel	p			 – Designed with wood from United’s property, three branches are intertwined to represent the three persons of the Holy Trinity. It also draws inspiration from Ecclesiastes 4:12, “A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.” There is space between the branches because God sees us as humans looking through the lens of the cross, forgiven because of the sacrifice Christ made there for our sins. Finally, the cross is not formed in straight lines but rather has a flowing style representing the movement of the Holy Spirit here at United and in each of our lives.
https://united.edu/our-chapel	b			The Stained Glass Windows
https://united.edu/our-chapel	p			 – The window on the left depicts God the Father through a hand over the waters of creation. God is the Father and Creator of the whole universe.  The window on the right depicts God the Holy Spirit represented by the dove radiating God’s love, joy and peace. These two windows with the cross in between representing God the Son, combine to represent the Holy Trinity.
