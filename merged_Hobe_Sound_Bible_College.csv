https://hsbc.edu/home/disclosures	em			Third-party services
https://hsbc.edu/home/disclosures	p			In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. For example, a credit-card processing company will use your information to make a charge.
https://hsbc.edu/home/disclosures	p			However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.
https://hsbc.edu/home/disclosures	p			For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers.
https://hsbc.edu/home/disclosures	p			In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us.
