https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			1968-69
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			The Pioneer Years
https://50.mvnu.edu	p			This was the beginning. New buildings, new faces, new experiences met the Pioneer Class as they arrived at MVNC. Excitement mingled with anticipation, hours of work and prayer, the old and the new, the constant, the special, all combined to form the miracle of the beginning.
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			1970-79
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			Growing with Grace
https://50.mvnu.edu	p			From the first four-year degrees to formal accreditation, MVNC grew with each passing year in academics, spiritual life, and community. Construction was a main focus for the development of the campus and new leadership made sacrificial progress that forged a way for those to come. 
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			1980-89
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			Making Dreams Reality
https://50.mvnu.edu	p			Coming into its own, MVNC grew in identity as it maintained steady growth in enrollment, noteworthy athletic achievements, and finalized plans to construct the R.R. Hodges Chapel/Auditorium and Fine Arts Center. This lifelong vision of its founders became a reality as the college celebrated its 20th Anniversary.
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			1990-93
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			The First 25 Years
https://50.mvnu.edu	p			The last decade of the 20th century was just another starting point for MVNC. From the 25th Anniversary to the development of a robust and strategic building plan, the college kept moving forward through faith, support, and purpose.
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			1994-2018
https://50.mvnu.edu	h4			The Second 25 Years
https://50.mvnu.edu	p			After celebrating 25 years of Christian higher education, Mount Vernon Nazarene College just kept growing. From an increase to enrollment and an emphasis on new academic programs, residential and academic facilities were constructed to fulfill the needs of students, faculty and staff.
