http://www.austinseminary.edu	em			How do you recharge?
http://www.austinseminary.edu	p			 A good long walk. Preferably 500 miles on the Camino. But 5 miles around Ladybird Lake is my local treat.
http://www.austinseminary.edu	em			Why did you choose your field?
http://www.austinseminary.edu	p			 In junior high school I started collecting church bulletins and printed copies of the ministers’ sermons. Why? What we did on Sunday mornings seemed urgent and I wanted to know more.

http://www.austinseminary.edu/admissions/austin	p			Students at Austin Seminary find plenty to do in this active, creative city—and with around 300 days of sunshine, much of it’s done outdoors. The city that launched Twitter (SWSX, 2011) and inspired the creation of Whole Foods, Tito's, and Dell Computers offers University of Texas football, Formula One racing, Barton Spring Pool, and enough marathons and music festivals to tie up traffic from here to eternity. On the quirky side, we have 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats living under a bridge downtown and a 50 -year tradition of celebrating Eeyore’s birthday. You won’t get hungry here either with 2000 food trucks, loads of mouth-watering barbecue, and, sigh, breakfast tacos!
