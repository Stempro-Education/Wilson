https://uc.edu	p			January 6, 2020
https://uc.edu	p			University of Cincinnati geography professor Tomasz Stepinski used high-resolution satellite images from the European Space Agency to study landscapes in 9-kilometer-wide blocks across every inch of the planet between 1992 and 2015. He found that deforestation occurs comparatively slowly in these blocks until about half of the forest is gone. Then the remaining forest disappears very quickly.

https://uc.edu	p			It’s more than a slogan. Bigger than a plan. It’s what drives us—our North Star, informing every decision, defining every moment, and shaping our tomorrow. Because we’re not just entering the future. We’re creating it. Our global, digital and knowledge economy demands that we adopt this new mindset: seeking the new, trying the unconventional, and accepting challenges from a position of Bold. Welcome to a new era of inclusion, innovation and impact. Welcome to Next.

https://uc.edu	h2			Proudly Cincinnati
https://uc.edu	p			Our city is a huge part of who we are and what we do. After all, it’s in our name. Cincinnati is our source for professional opportunities, creative inspiration and cultural celebration. It’s a place where quaint neighborhood festivals give way to the roar of big-league crowds. It’s big-city adventure with a generous dash of small-town charm. Visitors have called it amazing. We’re proud to simply call it home. 
https://uc.edu	a			Explore Cincy
https://uc.edu	h2			Experience
https://uc.edu	p			It’s different here. Which only makes sense, because we invented cooperative education back in 1906. And we’ve never stopped innovating. Today, experience-based learning is part of our DNA. From co-ops in Paris to service spring breaks in our own backyard, every UC student has the opportunity for real, meaningful career exploration. It’s not just “education, unleashed,” it’s a promise that every Bearcat graduates with a degree, a resume and a plan for the future.
