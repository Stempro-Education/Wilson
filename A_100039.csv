https://www.theamericancollege.edu/military	p		sup	Paul Henderson (Norfolk, VA) is an active duty Navy Lieutenant Commander currently stationed on aircraft carrier USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (CVN 72). An Annapolis graduate, he spent several years as a helicopter pilot, which included a tour where he was hand-selected for an assignment with 5th Fleet in Bahrain. During this tour, he was able to sit in on high-level meetings chaired by then General James Mattis. He says, “I went into the Navy to fly, but I have stayed in because of the people and camaraderie.” During another tour, a tragic accident swept a fellow helo pilot overboard into the Red Sea. Seeing his shipmate’s wife struggle with no life insurance was one of the inspirations for him to begin laying the groundwork for a career in the life insurance profession. While he still has several years prior to his transition, he has already earned his life and health license and serves as the command financial specialist. He will be pursuing the Chartered Life Underwriter
https://www.theamericancollege.edu/military	p		sup	 (CLU

https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	span			FROM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	strong			Welcome to The American College Penn Mutual Center for Veterans Affairs! 
https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	div			Our mission is to empower the men and women who have served honorably in the Armed Forces by providing educational support and career opportunities in the financial services industry. The crown jewel of our program is the full scholarship opportunity for active duty, veterans, and spouses.
https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	div			Veterans are uniquely qualified for a career in the financial services industry because they come from a culture of service and “can-do.” In addition, veterans are typically comfortable operating in an environment requiring attention to detail, compliance, and appreciate different cultures and backgrounds. With the increasing complexity of tax, estate, insurance, retirement, and college planning, there is a real need for individuals of integrity to help others address life’s major milestones with confidence and success. Veterans can step in and fill this need so many are looking for.
https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	div		em	I want to personally thank all of our donors, both individual and corporate, whose support is making a real difference. We are not only 
https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	em			Empowering Heroes
https://veterans.theamericancollege.edu	div			, we are also infusing the financial services with a talent pool for the next generation!
