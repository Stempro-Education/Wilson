http://www.harding.edu/2019	h1			2019 | A year in review
http://www.harding.edu/2019	h3			#HUreview19
http://www.harding.edu/2019	p	h3		In every season of 2019, we were inspired by strong individuals, new friends, milestone accomplishments, the Searcy community and our campus community. We celebrated events like Spring Sing and were inspired by ASI speakers like Tony Dungy. We came together to serve others and lift up our family following losses in our community. Overall, 2019 was another year for our students to connect, grow and bond through the experiences on our campus. Reflect back with us on some of our memorable moments of 2019, and take a look at memorable Instagram posts from each month. We pray for another year of connection, growth and learning in this community of mission.
