He administers the spiritual formation programs  and helps create a spiritual environment that reflects the CBS mission and contributes to personal and organizational transformation. Lee has been on staff with CBS since 2000, having previously served as Manager of Enrollment Marketing, Director of Communications and, initially, Director of Development.  Attending CBS strengthened Lee’s passion for God’s Word and discipleship. Having enjoyed the privilege of being discipled by a CBS professor, he was inspired to enroll at Dallas Theological Seminary to hone his skills and better prepare himself for service to the body of Christ (M.A., Biblical and Theological Studies, 2017).   Since 2004, Lee has led a weekly Bible study at Covenant House Texas, a homeless shelter for at-risk young adults. This experience has provided opportunities to disciple and mentor young men toward a biblical worldview and a greater capacity for leading independent lives as socially and economically responsible citizens of their community.   Lee has been a member of BridgePoint Bible Church since 2008, where his service to the body includes Bible teacher, spiritual encourager and prayer shepherd. Lee is a native of Houston, Texas. He studied graphic design at the University of Houston (B.F.A., 1989), where he qualified for the Yale University summer design program in Brissago, Switzerland. He worked for a branding and design firm for 12 years before being called to CBS.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Tracy L Winkler attended Houston Bible Institution or (HBI) in the early 1990’s when (CBS) was meeting at a local radio station for some of its classes. His goal was to learn Biblical literacy and find where God wanted him to serve in the Body of Christ. After being away for more than a decade, he came back to the College of Biblical Studies in 2005 to finish and pursue an Associates in Bible. He graduated in 2008  and then completed a Bachelor in Leadership from CBS in 2010. Since then, he completed a Master’s in Christian Education from Dallas Theological Seminary with a concentrate in Educational Leadership and a Doctorate in Educational Administration with a concentrate in Higher Education from the University of Mary-Hardin Baylor. He married his lovely wife, Cathy, in 2000. They have four teenage children which is among his interests in serving the Lord. His other interests are Special Needs ministry, (where he serves on a board of a local special needs organization,) Church history, with a specific focus on The Reformation, and revival/ spiritual awakening in the past. He has taught in the church in various capacities from Bible study, preaching as a pulpit supply and a missions coordinator for local para-church organizations. Dr. Winkler has recently joined the faculty of CBS with an appreciation of what he considers a “full circle” of educational endeavor. From being a student at CBS and now teaching as an instructor. One of his instructors, though many have inspired him, has stood out in his mind. Roy Ledgerwood, from the (HBI) days of CBS taught Church history, for example. Roy’s passion for church history has influenced and sparked his desire to continue a lifelong interests in Church history along with his other educational endeavors. It is with this same passion that Dr. Winkler wants his students to be inspired and explore their biblical interests as they serve the Lord and it is his hope to influence the next generation of CBS students to pursue a lifelong endeavor to learn. Some of his prior learning experiences in life has also uniquely prepared him to teach a class on Prior Learning Assessment or PLA. With this in mind, Dr. Winkler is teaching an elective class to help students benefit from their prior learning experiences. Students can receive credit for life experience through the PLA elective courses offered at CBS.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS has worked extensively to expand the opportunities for Crossroads’ students: More degree programs to choose from, lower tuition, expanded scholarships and financial aid, updated technology, modern campus, and most importantly, regional and national accreditation.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			“The College of Biblical Studies and Crossroads Bible College have long shared a common goal of bringing quality biblical higher education to a multiethnic population,” said Dr. Bill Blocker, president of the College of Biblical Studies. “This merger equips us to accomplish this mission in new and greater ways, and it establishes a richer foundation for Indiana communities.”
http://cbshouston.edu	span			"The merging of the two schools expands the reach of CBS with the addition of the Indianapolis and Fort Wayne campuses, as well as broadening the on-campus and online programs. “This merger provides our students with exciting opportunities that were not available before. Regional accreditation and new degree programs will prepare them for the future in ways we could not have done on our own."" said Dr. Charles Ware, president emeritus of Crossroads Bible College."
http://cbshouston.edu	span			With the completion of the merger, the colleges will operate as the College of Biblical Studies and will offer 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span		classes in Houston, Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and online.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Crossroads Bible College Leases Space at Iconic Indy Pyramids
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Houston, TX – The College of Biblical Studies in Houston, Texas has just announced the lease of 21,000 square feet in the Indy 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span		Pyramids at College Park, Indianapolis. This lease space will be the new  Indianapolis location of Crossroads Bible College. Crossroads Bible College and the College of Biblical Studies signed an agreement in early 2018 to pursue a merger of the two schools.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 “For CBS-Houston, this merger will expand its reach through the addition of an Indianapolis campus, several regional locations, and online offerings. For Crossroads, this merger will protect its rich heritage while securing a promising future and greater opportunities for students – including regional accreditation,” stated Dr. Bill Blocker, president of the College of Biblical Studies.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In March, Crossroads sold its current property at 601 N. Shortridge to Indiana Black Expo. “One of the most important factors in this merger is providing the best educational experience we can for our students. In selling the current property and relocating to a more modern facility, we can give our students advantages that we are unable to offer at Shortridge,” stated Dr. Charles Ware, president emeritus of Crossroads Bible College.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The decision to lease space at this Indy landmark was based on student and staff needs, such as modern conveniences, 24/7 onsite security, fitness center, onsite café, and proximity to the bus line. Classes will continue to be held at the Shortridge location until June 14, and classes will begin at the new location on June 17. The merger is expected to be finalized by June 30 at which time Crossroads will officially become the College of Biblical Studies.

http://cbshouston.edu	span	span	a	The College of Biblical Studies-Houston Board of Trustees are pursuing the merger of Crossroads Bible College in Indianapolis, Indiana, subject to the approval of ABHE and SACSCOC accreditation agencies. Leveraging its academic rigor and biblical worldview training, CBS offers a nationally and regionally accredited college education on campus and online, with several programs offered in the Spanish language. Students receive transformational education and training for service to families, ministries, businesses, and communities around the world. CBS has provided biblically based education to more than 26,000 students since 1976, and is ranked as one of the lowest tuitions in Texas. For more information on the pursuit of merger, visit

http://cbshouston.edu	span			After months of evaluation and due diligence, the CBS-Houston Board of Trustees has agreed to begin pursuing the merger of Crossroads Bible College in Indianapolis, Indiana, subject to the 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span		approval of ABHE and SACSCOC accreditation agencies. We believe Crossroads will be a great addition to the CBS-Houston family.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			This merger will accomplish the following:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Expand the CBS-Houston reach through the addition of an Indianapolis campus, several regional locations, and online offerings; 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Protect the rich heritage of Crossroads while securing a promising future filled with greater opportunities for students.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			About the College of Biblical Studies
http://cbshouston.edu	span			College of Biblical Studies
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 is located in Houston, Texas. Leveraging its academic rigor and biblical worldview training, CBS offers a nationally and regionally accredited college education on campus and online, with several programs offered in the Spanish language. Students receive transformational education and training for service to families, ministries, businesses, and communities around the world. CBS has provided biblically based education to more than 26,000 students since 1976, and is ranked as one of the lowest tuitions in Texas. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Why Merge?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			College of Biblical Studies (CBS) is committed to protecting the privacy of all students, regardless of modality. As a condition of retaining its regional SACSCOC accreditation, CBS is publishing its written procedure for protecting the privacy of students enrolled in distance and correspondence education courses and programs.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Approach and Procedure
http://cbshouston.edu	span	br	a	To protect the privacy of all students, including distance learning students, CBS supports and complies with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (
http://cbshouston.edu	a			FERPA
http://cbshouston.edu	span	br		) of 1974. CBS makes the text of the FERPA act available to all constituents via the CBS website and publications such as the Student Handbook and Academic Catalog.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			At enrollment, all CBS students are issued a unique student identification number. This student ID becomes the unique identifier for the student throughout his/her academic career at the College. CBS does not allow the use of the student's Social Security number as a means of systems access. The College also issues each student a unique CBS email address.
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	Through the unique student identification number or the student email address, along with a password, the student is able to access systems such as 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			SonisWeb
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	 (student information system), 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			GMail
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	 (student email system), 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			Blackboard
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	 (learning management system), 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			GlobalVFS
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 (financial aid system), etc. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In a similar fashion, college personnel are also issues unique login credentials for all CBS systems. In the event of CBS personnel no longer being employed by the school, the former employee's accounts are disabled to prevent access. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	To further help ensure the privacy of all students, all system account permissions follow the 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			principle of least privilege
http://cbshouston.edu	span			. This approach ensures that a given individual only has permissions to perform system functions and access data that is appropriate for their needs. All systems also employ encryption so that the data cannot be intercepted and read by 3rd parties. And finally, all systems are hosted and maintained by the vendor, ensuring that the systems stay updated and are housed in world-class data centers.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			What's unique about this college?
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	There are a few unique features about CBS. One unique feature is CBS is both a regionally and nationally accredited school. These accreditations put CBS on the same level as schools such as Texas A&M, UT, U of H and the like. Another unique feature is our 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			Mission statement
http://cbshouston.edu	span			. Furthermore, CBS seeks to offer its students Truth, Training, and Transformation.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What leads most students to choose College of Bibilical Studies (CBS)?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			There are a number of good reasons why most students choose CBS. We have a very generous credit transfer policy. Our tuition rates are far more reasonable than any other 4-year school. It is a way for the Christian college student to get a bachelor’s degree from an accredited school with Christian values. It is a fabulous “springboard” for those who are called to ministry to prepare them for seminary. It is a means for the community college graduate who is already entrenched in a career to go on and obtain a bachelor’s degree in order to improve his or her chances of promotion at work. CBS provides a world-class education at a reasonable investment.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			What qualities and experiences are you looking for in applicants? 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS seeks applicants who are professed Christians, who are looking to further their education, and who are seeking to grow in a deeper relationship with the Lord. (Truth, Training, Transformation)
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Can you tell me more about the application evaluation process?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			It is very easy to apply to CBS. Our application is online and represents a “turn-key” process for admission to the college. Upon full completion of the application and receipt of all required documents (transcripts, shot records, SAT/ACT scores, etc.) the CBS admissions team carefully reviews each application in order to determine admission status.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			How large of a role do SAT scores play in admissions? 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Your SAT/ACT scores may allow you to bypass CBS’ admissions testing process.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Can I meet with an admissions officer?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Absolutely! If you wish to meet with an admissions officer, make sure to set up a meeting via email or calling beforehand. If it is during application, usually two months before the beginning of a semester, try to schedule an appointment to ensure they are not too busy to meet with prospective students.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			What are the college’s most important values, and how does it demonstrate this to students? 
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	CBS’ values and vision are best stated in our 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			mission statement
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			What sort of student would succeed here? 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The profile of our most successful student is one who seeks to fulfill the imperative in 1 Cor. 10:31 and Col. 3:17 which (paraphrased) exhorts the believer to “do all to the glory of God”. Moreover, the successful student has a mindset to be challenged (but not overwhelmed) to glorify God through his or her seeking a deeper relationship with Him. Ultimately, it is this relationship that remains at the forefront of our successful student’s mind as he or she balances family, work, ministry, and school. The successful student delivers excellence in all these areas through maintaining this aforementioned perspective.  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Fianancial Aid
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What kind of need-based financial aid do you offer?
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	In addition to pell grant awards through fafsa. CBS offers a number of donor based 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			scholarships
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What information do you require besides the FAFSA?
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	On the CBS site, we have a financial aid portal known as “My FA”. This portal links fafsa’s assessment with our site in order for the student to see 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			what financial aid they have received
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Are there other scholarships that students can apply for at the time of application?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Yes. However, CBS does require each scholarship applicant to complete fafsa and My FA as well as register for classes. Since the scholarships are “needs-based” each application is reviewed individually by our scholarship review board to determine eligibility. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Can I renegotiate my offer if it’s lower than I expected? 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			While many institutions use the word “negotiate”, CBS prefers the word “appeal”. If you feel like you should qualify for more assistance, we do have an appeal process.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What are some opportunities for work-study?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS requires each student to serve in the Body of Christ in order to graduate. This requirement takes the form of Christian Service modules of 28 hours of service during 3 different semesters. Contact the Dean of Students for other work-study opportunities.  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Ask A Professor
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Meeting with a professor could be a great way for a prospective student to make contact and learn about a department and class, especially if the prospective student has a strong sense of his or her degree focus. The prospect can learn about the Prof’s teaching style, the department’s approach, and any opportunities for independent projects or research.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What are your expectations for students in your class? How can students succeed in your class?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students are expected to honor the Lord through their efforts to study “heartily as if for the Lord”. Timely attendance to class, submission of assignments, and maintaining comprehension of the assigned reading places the student in the best position to be successful.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What are typical requirements, like exams, papers, or presentations in a semester?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All of these requirements reflect the array of requirement options for a class. Depending on the class and grade level, there will be a combination of some or all of these aforementioned.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What kind of materials would I use in your class?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The required and recommended textbooks are always listed in the course syllabus. Having a personal computer is a staple for student success.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What skills or knowledge would you consider to be prerequisites?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS requires that a prospective student be a professed believer in Jesus Christ as the sole means for salvation. A high school diploma or GED is required for admission to CBS. A fundamental level of computer skills is necessary in order to fulfill the course requirements.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Do you offer any opportunities for students to do research?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Yes. Many of our courses require research.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Would I be required or able to write a senior thesis or do a capstone project?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Yes. Depending on the degree plan, some of our programs require a capstone project that can be in the form of a thesis.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			How much flexibility would l have in shaping my major or taking an interdisciplinary approach?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Some of our degree plans offer the flexibility of interdisciplinary studies due to the large number of elective courses in the program.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Some courses have pre-requisites and cannot be taken until other courses are satisfactorily completed.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			We believe the personal growth and communal ministry are an integral part of a student’s development at CBS. Thus, we prepared this course to reflect CBS’ commitment to improving student learning under the Quality Enhancement Plan of the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, by which CBS is accredited as an institution of higher education.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			We want everyone to be part of the “Stewardship” experience, so we have a stewardship-themed shirt that we will provide all CBS students to wear on “Stewardship T-shirt Day”.  As CBS students, you are essential to the success of our QEP program. Working together, we can help build the foundation of successful lifelong learners. To obtain your Stewardship T-shirt please stop by the student services offices (Houston Campus) the CBS Administrative Office (Indiana Pyramid) or CBS Administrative Office (Ft. Wayne) and we will be happy to provide you with a shirt. Please note sizes are limited, but we pray you will wear your Stewardship T-shirt proudly!

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Dear Friends of CBS:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In surveying our students, faculty and staff, we have discovered that while most are physically safe, many have suffered significant losses – homes or apartments flooded, books and computers lost, furnishings ruined…. At least half don’t have insurance to cover their losses.
http://cbshouston.edu	span		em	Students are registered for classes, eager to grow in their knowledge of the Bible – but they are unsure how they will pay for classes, books, computers, etc., when facing economic devastation at home. We want to help students continue their dreams of completing their education, despite Harvey’s damage – 
http://cbshouston.edu	em			but we need your help!
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Below is the form you can complete to contribute to the CBS Harvey Relief Fund.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 This fund will benefit students who have financial need and have suffered significant storm losses. It will benefit faculty and staff who have been impacted by Harvey. And it will help our campus recover from the aftermath of Harvey as we try to meet the special needs for student support, counseling, etc., that have arisen because of the storm.
http://cbshouston.edu	span		strong	We are extremely grateful for your generosity and your heart for our students and for our faculty and staff who dedicate their lives to educating and mentoring our students. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong		span	We are doubly blessed by our long-time, compassionate contributor David Weekley, chairman of David Weekley Homes, who has 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			agreed to match donations up to $50,000
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			 to assist those individuals with the greatest needs.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			CBS-Houston Convocation
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Thursday, September 5th, 2019
http://cbshouston.edu	span			7:30 pm - 8:30 pm (CDT)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS Campus, Room 104-107
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Light refreshments following the ceremony

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			What is Convocation?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			"The word Convocation derives from the Latin word convocare, which means ""together"" (con) and ""call"" (vocare). A convocation is an opportunity to formally call together or summon."
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Fall Convocation marks the start of a new academic year. The event celebrates the start of a new year with the excitement of meeting new people and new challenges - and it moves our students one step closer to commencement. We assemble to celebrate our God, who calls us and equips us for every good work to bring Him glory. During Convocation, we collectively and individually acknowledge our dependence on our Heavenly Father, through Christ Jesus and the power the Holy Spirit. We also reaffirm our striving for personal holiness and focus on personal ministry to others. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			We look forward to what God is going to do this fall as we start our new academic year, collectively worshiping and praising God in one accord!
http://cbshouston.edu	em			"""For who is our hope or joy or crown of exultation? Is it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? For you are our glory and joy"""

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Student must be eligible for financial aid (Pell and Loans) and have a credit balance on their account of $500.00 or more. This will include all FSA funds (Example: Pell and/or Student loans) 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All financial aid documents must be completed and ready for disbursement 10 days prior to the first start of class  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you are eligible for the financial aid, register early, and have funds remaining after tuition/fees are deducted, the CBS Office of Financial Aid will process a book voucher allowance for you. This book voucher authorization is not part of your financial aid. It is a short term loan from CBS as a courtesy to help defray expenses until financial aid funds can be processed and may not cover the total cost of your books. You will receive an email notifying you if you are eligible for a book voucher allowance. You can only use the book voucher in the CBS online book store and the total amount used will be deducted from your financial aid award before any excess refunds are made. If you wish to decline the book voucher allowance you must do so in writing. If you are eligible for Pell Grant or student loans and did not register in time for a book voucher allowance you must contact the Office of Financial Aid to see if you are eligible to have one processed.

The form will no longer be mailed because it can be retrieved by logging into the individual student’s account in myrecords.cbshouston.edu and by clicking on 1098-T at the top of their account page.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			This form is informational only and should not be considered as tax opinion or advice. It serves to alert students that they may be eligible for federal income tax education credits. Receipt of Form 1098-T does not indicate eligibility for the tax credit. To determine the amount of qualified tuition and fees paid, and the amount of scholarships and grants received, a taxpayer should use their own financial records. CBS does not provide tax advice and individuals should consult a tax advisor as needed.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			During enrollment periods students who have not met their financial obligations prior to the payment deadline will be administratively withdrawn from all registered courses and will remain responsible for any non-refundable fee charges the student incurred during the registration process.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 Any student owing a balance after any pre-agreed or published due date will be assessed a $50.00 late payment fee.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS reserves the right to withhold any grades, graded work assignments or projects, transcripts (unofficial & official), certificates, diplomas and participation in commencement ceremonies from students whose financial obligations have not been fully satisfied.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS reserves the right to submit any unpaid financial obligations of former and current students to a third party collection agency and to levy a collection fee. By registering for classes the student agrees to pay the reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including the collection agency fee and attorney fees in the event that CBS places any outstanding account, debt or claim with a collection agency. Non-payment of a delinquent account may also result in notification of the national credit bureaus.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Returned Checks
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students or organizations who submit two checks that are not honored by the bank (unless due to bank error) to CBS for tuition and fees, books or for any other obligation will forfeit their check-writing privileges. In the event that this occurs the student or organization must satisfy any current or future financial obligations by cash, cashier's check, money order or credit card only. No future checks from the student or organization will be accepted.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In addition, a student who has tendered to CBS a check returned unpaid by the bank will be assessed a $30 returned check fee. If payment is not submitted by the due date indicated, a $50.00 late payment fee will also be assessed and the student will be placed on holds.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			OTHER COMPLAINTS:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Within two years of the incident about which the student is complaining, he/she must contact the Commission for Higher Education using our complaint form.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Please note that the Commission cannot, by law, review complaints related to course grades, academic sanctions or discipline/conduct matters. In other areas, such as transferring credits between public institutions, the Commission has greater statutory authority.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Please follow the steps outlined below to submit a complaint:
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			STEP 1
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If a student has concerns related to classroom situations or administrative actions, he/she should contact the faculty or staff member(s) with whom he/she has a conflict. It may be possible to resolve the concerns without the need for formal institutional action. However, if the student’s complaint is not resolved satisfactorily, or if the complaint cannot be resolved by contacting the faculty or staff member(s), the student should proceed to STEP 2.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			STEP 2
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The student should file a complaint through his/her institution of higher education’s established complaint process. Information on the process can usually be found in the institution’s academic catalog, student handbook or website. If the student is unable to resolve the complaint in this manner, he/she should proceed to 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span		STEP 3
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			STEP 3
http://cbshouston.edu	span			After receiving a complaint through our complaint form, Commission staff will review the submitted materials and contact the submitter for any required additional information or clarifications. The Commission will then send a copy of the complaint to the institution against which the complaint has been filed and ask for a response within three weeks. After receiving the college or university’s response, Commission staff will determine whether the institution’s student complaint process has been followed and exhausted and what additional steps or follow-up may be taken. The Commission will inform both parties involved in the complaint.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Substantive Changes on New Initiatives
http://cbshouston.edu	span		strong	The College of Biblical Studies-Houston (CBS) tracks all of its programs and evaluates all new initiatives through established processes. Changes that deviate in a significant fashion from the current alignment of the institution will often require us to notify or seek approval of our accreditors. CBS has a policy on these types of changes (found 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			here
http://cbshouston.edu	span			), but a brief outline of these types of changes is provided below.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The following types of changes must be go through a special approval process at the College:
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Substantive Change
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 - A significant modification or expansion of the nature and scope of an accredited institution. Under federal regulations, substantive change includes
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Any change in the established mission or objectives of the institution
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Any change in legal status, form of control, or ownership of the institution
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The addition of courses or programs that represent a significant departure, either in content or method of delivery, from those that were offered when the institution was last evaluated
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The addition of courses or programs of study at a degree or credential level different from that which is included in the institution’s current accreditation or reaffirmation
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A change from clock hours to credit hours
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A substantial increase in the number of clock or credit hours awarded for successful completion of a program
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The establishment of an additional location geographically apart from the main campus at which the institution offers at least 50% of an educational program
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The establishment of a branch campus
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Closing a program, off-campus site, branch campus or institution
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Entering into a collaborative academic arrangement that includes only the initiation of a dual or joint academic program with another institution
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Acquiring another institution or a program or location of another institution
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Adding a permanent location at a site where the institution is conducting a teach-out program for a closed institution
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Entering into a contract by which an entity not eligible for Title IV funding offers 25% or more of one or more of the accredited institution’s programs
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Any additional change approved by the institution’s accreditors as requiring substantive change in their substantive change policies
http://cbshouston.edu	span			It is the responsibility of the College's Accreditation Liaison to:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Assess any Substantive Change in the institution for accreditor requirements
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Determine what action(s) with respect to accreditors is/are needed; 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			File the appropriate notification, request, or prospectus with the accreditor(s) in a timely manner; 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Liaise between the accreditor(s) and the College about any required follow-up action.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Communicate the renewal of this policy with Academic and Administrative Leadership and Faculty, as well as new management employees through their IE training module.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			The College of Biblical Studies Campus Carry Policy 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS takes the safety and well-being of our staff, students, and campus visitors very seriously. It is one of our top priorities, and it is with utmost care and diligence that we make decisions such as this.  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			After extensive review and evaluation of decisions from other private higher ed institutions, along with input from our staff, faculty, and students, a recommendation to opt out of campus carry was presented to the CBS board of trustees, and was approved on June 28, 2016.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Therefore, CBS has opted out of the campus carry law. Weapons WILL NOT be allowed on CBS campus.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Campus Carry Law at a Glance:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Campus Carry Law S.B. 11 provides that license holders may carry a concealed handgun throughout university campuses, starting Aug. 1, 2016. However, the law gives private universities discretion to regulate campus carry including:
http://cbshouston.edu	span		strong	•Section (1)(e ) A private or independent institution of higher education in this state, 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			after consulting with student, staff, and faculty of the institution, may establish rules, regulations, or other provisions prohibiting license holders from carrying handguns on the campus of the institution, any grounds or building on which an activity sponsored by the institution is being conducted, or a passenger transportation vehicle owned by the institution.
http://cbshouston.edu	span		strong	The campus carry law applies to all land and buildings owned or leased by an institution of higher education. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Open carry is not permitted on CBS property.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 Violators of the campus carry law will be subject to gun confiscation, legal action, and possible revocation of their CHL by state authorities. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			SPECIAL NOTE:
http://cbshouston.edu	strong		span	The campus carry law as noted above is not open carry 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			but allows for carrying of a concealed handgun by a licensed holder.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Campus Carry FAQ’s
http://cbshouston.edu	strong		br	When will the campus carry law take effect?
http://cbshouston.edu	span	strong		August 1, 2016
http://cbshouston.edu	strong		br	What is the difference between open carry and campus carry?
http://cbshouston.edu	span		br	Open Carry 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	strong		The Texas Penal Code generally regulates when and where handguns may be carried. Where Texas law or regulation prohibits possession of firearms on particular premises, the prohibitions are enforced as a matter of criminal law. The open carry legislation states that holders of a handgun license may now carry their handgun visibly in a waist belt holster or a shoulder holster. Prior legislation, however, provided a number of locations where the carrying of a concealed handgun, notwithstanding licensure, was prohibited. See Texas Penal Code sections 46.03 & 46.035. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Senate Bill 11 only allows for the concealed carry of handguns by licensed holders on campus. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Consequently, open carry is not allowed on the CBS campus.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong		br	Campus Carry: 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span	strong	Prior to changes made in the 84th Legislature, individuals, with certain exceptions, such as law enforcement personnel, were prohibited from carrying handguns inside any CBS buildings, even if the individual held a concealed handgun license (CHL). Senate Bill 11 Campus Carry, mandates that, pursuant to a prescribed process, institutions of higher education alter their rules governing handgun possession. While the 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			open carry
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span	strong	 legislation allows licensed holders, starting January 01, 2016, to openly carry their handguns in various locations in the State of Texas, the 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			campus carry
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span		 legislation broadens the right for licensed holders to carry handguns in a concealed manner on college campuses, if deemed appropriate by the college. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong		br	What other safety measures does CBS have in place?
http://cbshouston.edu	span	strong	a	Campus officials work hard to ensure the safety of our campus community. For more information see

http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Campus Carry
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In accordance with Chapter 46.03 of the Texas Penal Code, the College of Biblical Studies-Houston prohibits the possession and use of firearms, explosives and/or ammunition, fireworks, incendiary devices, illegal knives or other sharp blades, or other prohibited weapons in 46.05 of the Texas Penal Code on its property. For purposes of this policy, CBS property includes, but is not limited to, all CBS facilities, CBS-provided parking areas, vehicles, and equipment that are either leased or owned by CBS. In addition, CBS strictly prohibits the unlawful carrying or possession of any weapon in a CBS parking facility or parking area, including in employee-owned vehicles parked on CBS property. This prohibition includes any devices that might reasonably be mistaken for a firearm or weapon. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Under Texas state law (Senate bill 1907), licensed holders may transport and store handguns and ammunitions in private locked vehicles while parked on the campus but may not carry a handgun or ammunition into the CBS building or on CBS property. All other non-licensed persons are not allowed to store handguns and ammunition in their private vehicles. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In accordance with Texas state laws, including the open carry, campus carry and concealed weapons laws, CBS will not allow a licensed permit holder to bring a firearm onto the CBS campus. The only exception to this law is for authorized law enforcement and police officers. Exceptions to this policy must be authorized in advance and in writing by the CBS administration. Violations of this policy will be considered a serious offense and will be referred to both internal administrative authorities and external police authorities. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS employees and students share the responsibility of identifying violators of this policy. An employee or student who witnesses or suspects another individual of violating this policy should immediately report this information to security, their supervisor, or human resources. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS reserves the right to request the appropriate license of any individual in accordance with this policy and Texas state law, and to require the immediate removal of the weapon and the individual from its property.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Violation of this policy may subject an employee or student to disciplinary action up to including termination or expulsion.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Weapons on Campus
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies passionately teaches about and believes in the holy, righteous, loving, and forgiving triune God Who is responsible for giving all good gifts to His children (James 1:17). As a community of faith that trains men and women for Christian service, we desire to pursue His holy purposes and model His forgiving, redeeming, love to all with whom we come in contact (John 13:34 and 15:12). In His grace, God has revealed His sovereign purposes in His written Word and in the living Word of the person of Jesus Christ, Who is completely pure and without sin as the perfect High Priest and sacrifice for our sins (John 1:1-18; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 2:21-23; Hebrews 2:17-18, 4:14-15, 9:11-12). While on this earth, we will never live lives of complete sinless perfection as Jesus did or know all that the triune God knows; nevertheless, we desire to emulate the standards of holiness and love that God has established for us. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Consistent with our mission of providing biblically based education, the College embraces the Bible as the authoritative source of all beliefs about the sanctity of human life (John 17:17; 1 Corinthians 2:12-13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). The Bible portrays human life as sacred with inherent value because humans are created in the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27, 5:1-2; 1 Corinthians 11:7; James 3:9). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			As a result, the College of Biblical Studies does not endorse the taking of a life without just cause including, but not limited to, murder, abortion, euthanasia, and suicide.  Capriciously murdering another individual without biblical warrant is an affront to God, Who created man in His image (Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17, 19:10; Proverbs 1:15-16; Matthew 5:21, 15:19; Romans 13:9; Galatians 5:21; 1 Timothy 1:9; James 2:11; 1 John 3:12; Revelation 22:15). Suicide is an unbiblical way to escape the pain one feels and is never endorsed in Scripture (Judges 9:54-57; 1 Samuel 31:4-6, 1 Kings 16:18-9; 1 Chronicles 10:4, 13-14; Matthew 27:3-5). Abortion is contrary to the biblical mandate for mothers to protect their children, including those who are in the womb (Proverbs 31:27-28; Isaiah 49:15; 66:13). The Bible declares that life begins at conception and that abortion, even when the infant will be born with disabilities or infirmities, is an unnecessary taking of that life (Judges 13:2-7; Job 10:8-12; Psalm 139:13-16; Isaiah 49:1,5; 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Jeremiah 1:4; Luke 1:44; Ephesians 1:4).  Forms of contraception that have the same effect as an abortion (e.g., morning after pill, abortifacients) should also be avoided. Other forms of contraception should be considered by married couples only after prayer and consultation with appropriate medical and pastoral staff. Forms of in vitro fertilization in which the human embryos and/or fertilized eggs are destroyed and not preserved should also be avoided. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The human body following physical death still possesses inherent value since it is the handiwork of God and will one day be physically resurrected from the dead (John 5:28-29; 1 Corinthians 15; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; Revelation 20:11-15). Consequently, any form of biotechnology that dishonors human dignity should be avoided. While the College values organ donations and non-embryonic stem cell research, an individual should not consider abortion or suicide as a good means to provide stem cells or organs to others.  Forcing euthanasia on some (e.g., aged, criminal, insane, special needs, economically and socially disadvantaged) to take advantage of organ donation and/or generate other societal benefits devalues the inherent value of life.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Situations in Which One May Have a Biblical Cause to Take a Life
http://cbshouston.edu	span			There are some instances in which the Bible permits the taking of a human life under specific conditions.  The Bible endorses capital punishment when justly and biblically applied as a means to demonstrate the severity of murder and preserve the dignity of human life (Genesis 9:6; Exodus 21:12; Leviticus 24:17-22; Numbers 35:30-31; Romans 13:4). Christians should be advocates for justice in all areas of society and the world (Deuteronomy 16:20; Psalm 82:3; Proverbs 31:8-9; Isaiah 1:17; Jeremiah 22:3; Micah 6:8; Matthew 12:18-20). The Bible also allows for killing within the context of a just war or for an agent of the government having just cause to perform those duties required to preserve law and order (Deuteronomy 20:1-4; 1 Samuel 15:3; Romans 13:4; 2 Timothy 2:3). Furthermore, decisions concerning medical life support should also be made with medical and pastoral counsel. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			A Biblical Response to Those Who Have Taken a Life without Cause
http://cbshouston.edu	span			As the lives of King David and the Apostle Paul illustrate, the Bible offers forgiveness to all murderers and those who have not appreciated the sanctity of life (Psalm 51:7-9; Ephesians 4:32; 1 Timothy 1:12-16; 1 John 1:9). As such, Christians should treat any individual who has done so with compassion and love in hopes that God may bring such a one to repentance (2 Corinthians 7:8-10; Galatians 6:1; 1 Peter 4:8). Repentance does not excuse the earthly consequences of such actions, but it does bring the forgiveness of God (2 Samuel 12:13-23). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about CBS Statement on the Sanctity of Human Life 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies passionately teaches about and believes in the holy, righteous, loving, and forgiving triune God Who is responsible for giving all good gifts to His children (James 1:17). As a community of faith that trains men and women for the Christian service, we desire to pursue His holy purposes and model His forgiving, redeeming, love to all with whom we come in contact (John 13:34 and 15:12). In His grace, God has revealed His sovereign purposes in His written word and in the living Word of the person of Jesus Christ, Who is completely pure and without sin as the perfect High Priest and sacrifice for our sins (John 1:1-18; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 2:21-23; Hebrews 2:17-18, 4:14-15, 9:11-12). While on this earth, we will never live lives of complete sinless perfection as Jesus did or know all that the triune God knows; nevertheless, we desire to emulate the standards of holiness and love that God has established for us. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Consistent with our mission of providing biblically based education, the College of Biblical Studies embraces the Bible as the authoritative source of all beliefs about human sexuality (John 17:17; 1 Corinthians 2:12-13; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). The Bible portrays human sexuality as a gift given by God to the first married couple, originally biologically created as male and female,  to unite them for the purposes of pleasure and procreation to the glory of God (Genesis 1:27-28; 2:24; Matthew 19:5). God is the author of sex, and in holy heterosexual matrimony, He encourages a husband and wife to enjoy his or her spouse in love (Proverbs 5:18-19; Song of Songs 4:10, 5:16, 7:8-9). Married couples are encouraged not to consider their bodies as their own but to put the legitimate sexual needs of their spouse first, and to meet the spouse’s needs whenever possible (1 Corinthians 7:3-5). All board members, administrators, faculty, staff members, students, applicants, and all volunteers must agree to, adhere to in attitudes, actions and beliefs these principles as well as the below-outlined actions and other related acts that are prohibited in Scripture, both explicitly and in principle (Romans 12:1-2). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The holy purpose of God from the very beginning was for sex and marriage to be monogamous between one man and one woman, as originally biologically created by God, united in holy matrimony for life (Malachi 2:14-16; Matthew 19:4-6; Ephesians 5:31-32). This design was marred by sin which twisted God’s purpose and began to promote sex for pleasure without the unique monogamous covenantal marriage commitment that the Bible requires (Romans 1:24-25; 1 Thessalonians 4:5).  While God allowed polygamy to occur in the lives of Abraham, David, Solomon, and others (Genesis 2:24; Deuteronomy 17:17), He never specifically endorsed such an activity; in fact, the Bible does explicitly state that Christians, especially those in church leadership, should maintain the monogamous commitment to one spouse for life (1 Timothy 3:2; Titus 1:6). Similarly, while God permitted divorce and remarriage under certain specific situations (Deuteronomy 24:1-4; Matthew 19:7-9), His original design was for one husband and one wife to be united for life (Matthew 19:4-6). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Some sexual actions are always prohibited in the Bible including, but not limited to, fornication, adultery, homosexuality, transgender identification, bestiality/zoophilia, prostitution, rape, and sinful lust in all forms. For instance, sex outside of marriage is always prohibited, especially for the Christian whose body has been bought by the price of Christ’s blood and is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:13-20; Hebrews 13:4). Furthermore, the Bible discourages Christians from associating with believers who are involved in unrepentant sexual immorality (Psalm 50:16-23; 1 Corinthians 5:9-11, 15:33). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Fornication, or sexual relations before the marriage covenant (including cohabitation), is always prohibited in the Bible (Matthew 5:19-20; Romans 1:29; 1 Corinthians 7:2, 10:8; Galatians 5:19; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Revelation 2:20). In fact, the Bible never endorses sexual behavior outside of the marital relationship. Similarly, adultery, that is, a married person having sexual relations with someone who is not his or her spouse, is always prohibited (Exodus 20:14; Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 5:18; Proverbs 2:16-19, 6:32; Malachi 3:5; Mark 7:21; Galatians 5:19; 1 Corinthians 6:9; James 2:11). In fact, God specifically says that His desire to keep marriage undefiled is a reason why He consistently judges adultery and fornication (Ephesians 5:3-6; Colossians 3:5-6; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-6; Hebrews 13:4). Additionally, the Bible specifically prohibits all forms of non-heterosexual monogamous marital expression, including but not limited to, homosexuality and bisexuality (Leviticus 18:22, 20:13-16; Romans 1:26-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:8-11; Jude 7-8), as such acts are contrary to God’s original design of sex and marriage between one man and one woman (Gen. 1:27-28; 2:24; Mat. 19:5) for God’s purpose for procreation (Gen. 1:27-28; 9:1, 7; Leviticus 26:9; Psalm 127:3-5; Malachi 2:15 and 1 Timothy 5:14). Despite the fact that homosexuality occurred and was endorsed by many during the time when the Bible was written, the Bible never endorses homosexual relationships and/or homosexual marriage. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Similarly, the Bible encourages Christians to understand their sexual orientation and sexual identity in the original design of God as biologically created at birth: male and female with distinct differences but equal value in God’s eyes (Genesis 1:27, 5:2; 1 Peter 3:7). In fact, a Christian should find his or her primary identity in Christ as a child of God (John 1:12; Galatians 2:20; Colossians 3:1-3, 1 John 3:1-2). As a result, the Bible forbids individuals from adopting a gender identity that conflicts with the biological sex they received from birth and to affirm others who accept the sex they were biologically assigned at birth (Deuteronomy 22:5; 1 Corinthians 6:9, where use of µa?a??? means “effeminate” or indicating a rejection of one’s God-given, biological sex). The Bible teaches that exchanging the natural functions of the God-given sex for unnatural functions (including same-sex attraction or desiring to convert to another gender) is a result of sin (Romans 1:26-27). The Bible recognizes only two sexes — male and female — and a trust in the sovereignty of God will lead Christians to display and adopt only the sex God biologically gave them at birth (Genesis 5:2; Matthew 19:4). To do otherwise through sex reassignment, transvestite, transgender, gender-fluid, or nonbinary “genderqueer” and related acts or conduct is to question God’s providence and sovereignty. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Furthermore, the Bible expressly forbids bestiality/zoophilia, prostitution, incest, rape, and lust in all forms (Exodus 22:19; Leviticus 18:6-18, 23; 20:15-16, 21:14; Deuteronomy 22:25-27, 23:17-18, 27:20-23; 2 Samuel 13:12-14; Matthew 5:27-28; 1 Corinthians 6:15-18; Ephesians 4:17-19; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; 2 Timothy 2:22). Such actions reject God’s original design for sex, do not represent the selfless relationship of Christ and the church, malign the worth of the body as the temple of the Holy Spirit, and cause extensive harm to others. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In addition to the above, there are some items that the Bible does not directly address but provides principles that guide Christian conduct. For instance, pornography, polyamorous marriage, pedophilia, sexting, voyeurism, and sex trafficking all are forbidden based on the prohibitions against lust and care for other individuals provided in the Bible (Amos 1:6; Matthew 5:27-28; 1 Corinthians 6:15-18; Ephesians 4:17-19; 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5; 2 Timothy 2:22). Additionally exhibitionism, identification as an animal, self-marriage/sologamy, objectophilia, self-masturbation and all other selfish sexual acts are against God’s purpose of creating humans in His image and sex for the union of husband and wife in marriage. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Bible states that individuals who struggle with same-sex attraction, who have practiced sexual acts condemned explicitly or implicitly by the Bible, or who have sinfully lusted in their hearts can receive God’s abundant grace through faith in the substitutionary work of Jesus Christ on the cross in their place as payment for their sins (Ephesians 2:1-10).  The Bible encourages anyone involved in such acts or thoughts and attractions to repent of such actions as well as thoughts, and confess these actions and thoughts as sin (2 Corinthians 12:21; 1 John 1:9; Revelation 2:21). Believers should  pursue a righteous view of sex and accompanying actions by faith in the redeeming work of Jesus Christ as well as the power of the Holy Spirit to overcome temptation (1 Corinthians 10:13; Galatians 5:16-18; Ephesians 4:20-24; Hebrews 2:17-18, 4:14-16). While some may be more likely to struggle with certain sins, the Bible gives examples that these sins can be overcome by the power of the Holy Spirit through faith in Jesus Christ (Matthew 21:31-32; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11).  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Because a person can escape a lifestyle of sexual immorality, CBS encourages its board, faculty, staff, and students to demonstrate the love of Christ to all individuals, regardless of the sexual sins with which they may struggle (Matthew 9:10-13; John 8:3-11; 1 Corinthians 5:9-10; Colossians 4:5-6). As Christians, we should afford them the love and respect they deserve as people created in the image of God. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Scriptures command Christians to be compassionate and sensitive to those who are experiencing the temptation towards same-sex attraction, the desire to abandon their God-given gender at birth, the struggle with what the Bible says about sex, and the confession of previously-committed immoral acts. Special consideration should be given to those who express a willingness to change by faith in Jesus Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit and conform to these standards expressed in belief and act to the “CBS Statement on Biblical, Holy, Human Sexuality” (2 Corinthians 7:8-10; James 5:20; 1 Peter 4:8). The Bible commands Christians to be reconciled with a repentant brother in a spirit of humility and gentleness (Galatians 6:1-2).   
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS believes that God gives two life-enhancing options for human sexual behavior according to the Bible:  (1) a regular, active, biblical conjugal “one flesh” marital sexual union of one man and one woman to help overcome the temptations of the evil one (1 Corinthians 7:3-5), and (2) celibacy (Isaiah 56:3-5; Matthew 19:10-12; 1 Corinthians 7:7, 26-28). Those who cannot control their sexual urges are encouraged to pursue biblical marriage unless they are prevented biblically and/or situationally by God from doing so (1 Corinthians 7:2, 9). Both celibacy and marriage are gifts from God by His will, with their own unique blessings and challenges, and should be received with great joy and faith. Celibacy and faithful singleness as well as godly monogamous marriage are to be celebrated and affirmed within the College.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			BLOW:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 Tilt the head back and listen for breathing. If not breathing normally, pinch nose and cover the mouth with yours and blow until you see the chest rise. Give 2 breaths. Each breath should take 1 second.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			PUMP:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 If the victim is still not breathing normally, coughing or moving, begin chest compressions. Push down on the chest 1 1/2 to 2 inches 30 times right between the breasts. Pump at the rate of 100/minute, faster than once per second.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			CONTINUE WITH 2 BREATHS AND 30 PUMPS UNTIL HELP ARRIVES - NOTE:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 This ratio is the same for one-person & two-person CPR. In two-person CPR the person pumping the chest stops while the other gives mouth-to-mouth breathing.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the victim is choking:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Make sure they are coughing and getting air.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the victim cannot speak or cough and you think something maybe lodged in their throat, from behind, slip your arms around the victim’s waist. Make a fist with one hand and grasp with the other hand. Place your fist right above the navel area. Press into the abdomen with quick upward thrust. Repeat until the object is removed, or the victim starts breathing or coughing.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			"The College of Biblical Studies appreciates and values God’s gift of marriage between man and woman that God created in His own image. As a Bible College committed to providing our students with a biblical worldview, CBS fully believes what the Bible says about marriage and operates according to that faith commitment. We abide by Jesus’s teaching on marriage when He said, “Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning MADE THEM MALE AND FEMALE, 5 and said, 'FOR THIS REASON A MAN SHALL LEAVE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER AND BE JOINED TO HIS WIFE, AND THE TWO SHALL BECOME ONE FLESH'? 6 ""So they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate"" (Matthew 19:4b-6 NASB, capitalization in the original). "
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The definition of marriage provided by Jesus includes several important truths that CBS expects all board members, faculty members, students and staff to value and abide by: 1) Marriage is a covenant designed by God (19:4b). 2) This biblical definition of marriage is not conditioned by culture or personal perspective but decided by God from the beginning and expected to continue until eternity (v. 4b). 3) Marriage is intended to be between one man and one woman as God biologically created them male and female at birth (v. 4b). Hence, any other proposals for marriage are outside of God’s intended design (see also Leviticus 18:22, 20:13–16; Romans 1:26–27; 1 Corinthians 6:9–11; and 1 Timothy 1:9–10). 4) The marriage covenant is sealed through sexual intercourse which should be reserved for one husband and one wife after they have entered the holy covenant of marriage (v. 5). 5) God’s design is for marriage to last until the death of one of the spouses (v. 6 and Matthew 22:30).  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Therefore, the College of Biblical Studies defines marriage as a divinely designed biblical covenant between one man and one woman and God that is intended to represent the relationship of Christ and the Church, and last until the death of either spouse. This view of marriage is affirmed in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament (see Genesis 1:27, 2:23–24; Malachi 2:14; Song of Solomon 2:7, 16; 1 Corinthians 7:1–16; Ephesians 5:22–33; Hebrews 13:4).

http://cbshouston.edu	li			A respondent’s use of any drug, including alcohol, judged to be related to an offense may be considered to be an exacerbating rather than mitigating circumstance.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Relationship to parallel proceedings.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			The college investigation and disciplinary procedures for allegations of sexual violence will proceed independently of any action taken in criminal or civil courts.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			The college will not delay its proceedings while a parallel legal action is on-going.

http://cbshouston.edu	li			Discretion to pursue certain allegations.

http://cbshouston.edu	li			Discretion to deal with policy violations disclosed in investigation.  
http://cbshouston.edu	li			The college reserves the right to determine whether to pursue violations of policy by students or employees other than the respondent, including a complainant or witness that comes to light during the investigation of an incident of sexual violence.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			In order to encourage reporting of sexual violence, under appropriate circumstances college administrators may choose to deal with violations of college policy in a manner other than disciplinary action.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Sanctions.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Sanctions that may be imposed if a finding is made that sexual violence has occurred include, but are not limited to, suspension, expulsion of students or termination from employment.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			The appropriate sanction will be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into account the severity of the conduct, the student’s or employee’s previous disciplinary history, and other factors as appropriate.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Retaliation prohibited. Actions by a student or employee intended as retaliation, reprisal or intimidation against an individual for making a complaint or participating in any way in a report or investigation under this policy are prohibited and are subject to appropriate disciplinary action.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Sexual violence prevention and education.

http://cbshouston.edu	li			Training for individuals charged with decision making authority.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Prior to serving as either an investigator or decision maker for complaints under this procedure, administrators must complete investigator or decision maker training.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Investigators/decision makers and anyone else involved in the adjudication process must receive annual training on the issues related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and how to conduct an investigation and hearing process that protects the safety of victims and promotes accountability.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Maintenance of report/complaint procedure documentation.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Data that is collected, created, received, maintained or disseminated about incidents of sexual violence will be handled in accordance with the privacy requirements and other applicable laws.

Such information will be used to report campus crime statistics on college and university campuses as required by that Act. 
http://cbshouston.edu	li			During and upon the completion of the complaint process, the complaint file shall be maintained in a secure location.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Shelter-in-place means to seek immediate shelter and remain there during an emergency rather than evacuate the area. It is always preferred to evacuate. Shelter-in-place should only be used when an evacuation is not safe.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Certain events may necessitate the initiation of the College’s shelter-in-place protocol. The decision to shelter-in-place will be made by the president or his designee. Once the decision has been made, the director of real estate operations will instruct the campus community to shelter-in-place. This notification will be made using the CBS Watchman Alert System.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Shelter-in-place procedures are outlined under each emergency where appropriate. General shelter-in-place procedures are as follows:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Upon receiving notification to shelter-in-place:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay in your office/classroom.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Notify those around you, and encourage others to remain in their office/classroom rather than to try to leave the building.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Lock the doors, cover the door window, close the blinds, turn off the lights, and stay calm.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay away from the windows.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Check your phone messages, email, and the College website. If a TV is available, turn it on, turn the volume off.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Report any suspicious activity, sounds, or smells to the director of real estate operations, or call 911.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Only come out when you recognize the authority directing you to do so.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			General Evacuation Procedures
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If an evacuation is ordered, follow these procedures:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay calm, do not rush, and do not panic.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Gather your personal belongings if it is safe to do so. (Reminder: take prescription medications out with you if at all possible. It may be hours before you are allowed back in the building.)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If safe, close your office door and window, but do not lock them.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Use the nearest stairs and proceed to the nearest exit as outlined on the fire escape map located in each room of the building. Do not use the elevator.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Wait for any instructions from emergency responders or received from the CBS Watchman Emergency Alert.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not re-enter the building or work area until you have been instructed to do so by the emergency responders.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Evacuation Procedures for People with Disabilities 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			People with disabilities will often need assistance evacuating. Always ASK someone with a disability how you can help BEFORE attempting any rescue technique or giving assistance. Ask how he or she can best be assisted or moved, and whether there are any special considerations or items that need to come with the person. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Evacuating a disabled or injured person yourself is the last resort. Consider your options and the risks of injuring yourself and others in an evacuation attempt. Do not make an emergency situation worse. Evacuation is difficult and uncomfortable for both the rescuers and people being assisted. Some people have conditions that can be aggravated or triggered if they are moved incorrectly. Remember that environmental conditions (smoke, debris, loss of electricity) will complicate evacuation efforts.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Use the following guidelines:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			DO NOT use elevators, unless authorized to do so by police or fire personnel. Elevators could fail during a fire or major earthquake. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the situation is life threatening, call 911. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Check on people with mobility disabilities during an evacuation. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Attempt a rescue evacuation ONLY if you have had rescue training or the person is in immediate danger and cannot wait for professional assistance. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In particular, be aware when assisting someone with a disability. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The individual with the disability is the best expert in his or her disability, so ask that individual for advice before lifting or moving him/her. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Take extra time when communicating with people who are deaf, hearing impaired, or speech impaired. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Never separate a disabled person from his or her assistive aids: wheelchairs, canes, hearing aids, medications, special diet food, urinary supplies, etc. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A disabled person’s equipment may not be working after a disaster occurs, or it may be insufficient for emergency circumstances. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A service animal, usually a dog, is an assistive aid used by some blind, deaf, and mobility-impaired people. A disaster may temporarily confuse service animals and they may not be able to help their owners as effectively as before the disaster. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Some individuals with emotional and developmental disabilities may be too unsettled to respond appropriately to instructions and directions, such as a public address announcement to evacuate a building. Some disabled individuals may need to be in a quiet place for a while to regain their composure; others may even try to hide from rescue workers. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Some individuals with significant mental or learning disabilities might not understand the significance of “Keep Out” signs and barricade tape.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Assisting the blind or visually impaired:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Give verbal instructions to advise about safest route or direction using compass directions, estimated distances, and directional terms.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			DO NOT grasp a visually impaired person’s arm. Ask if he or she would like to hold onto your arm as you exit, especially if there is debris or a crowd.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Give other verbal instructions or information (i.e. elevators cannot be used). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Assisting the deaf or hearing impaired:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Get the attention of a person with a hearing disability by touch and eye contact. Clearly state the problem. Gestures and pointing are helpful, but be prepared to write a brief statement if the person does not seem to understand.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Offer visual instructions to advise of safest route or direction by pointing toward exits or evacuation maps. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Assisting the mobile impaired:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			It may be necessary to help clear the exit route of debris (if possible) so that the person with a disability can move to a safer area.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If people with mobility impairments cannot exit, they should move to a safer area and wait for assistance from first responders.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Notify police or fire personnel immediately about any people remaining in the building and their locations.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Police or fire personnel will decide whether people are safe where they are and will evacuate them as necessary. The fire department may determine that it is safe to override the rule against using elevators.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If people are in immediate danger and cannot be moved to a safer area to wait for assistance, it may be necessary to evacuate them using an evacuation chair or a carry technique. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Discuss with the user of the wheelchair how to lift the user and the wheelchair either together or separately. When circumstances necessitate separating the user and the wheelchair, keep the period of separation to a minimum. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Some parts of a wheelchair are safe to lift, others are not. Always ask the user to confirm where it is safe to lift. Also, ask the user what else you should know about his or her wheelchair in order to lift it safely. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Wheelchairs with four wheels (not three-wheeled scooters) usually have handbrakes on each side of the chair. When the wheelchair is to remain stationary, set both brakes. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			When the lifting is complete, follow the instructions of the user and restore the manual or motorized wheelchair to full operation; then direct the user to a safe area. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Power Outages
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If an outage occurs during the day and people with disabilities choose to wait in the building for electricity to be restored, they can move near a window where there is natural light and access to a working telephone. Advise emergency personnel.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Evacuation Procedure
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Utility Interruption Emergencies
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All utility interruptions (gas, water, or electric) should be reported to facilities at 713.545.8543. If no answer or after hours, call security at 281.448.4900.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If necessary, the director of real estate operations will inform the president or a vice president concerning the nature of the emergency and the anticipated time of restoration of service, if known.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Under some circumstances, power interruptions may be anticipated. During the summer months when demand for electricity is high, the College may experience a planned interruption or rolling blackouts as required by the local utility company. Normally, the College will have advanced warning when this occurs.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If it becomes necessary to reduce energy consumption, the following will be instituted:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Condition Amber (Curtailed Load)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Shut off all lights and equipment not essential for safe operations. Power down all equipment after each use and only turn on that which is needed to complete work. The cooling plant will be taken offline; but staff will endeavor to maintain fan operation to provide ventilation in the buildings.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Condition Red (Power Failure Imminent)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Shut off all lighting (except for emergency lighting) and extinguish any open flames. Take measures to protect equipment. Voltage may fluctuate. Remember, air operated controls and domestic water pressure may be affected. The elevator may be taken out of service.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Power Blackout 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Set all switches to “OFF” position.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Report persons trapped in elevator to facilities.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you are located in an area where there is no emergency lighting or it fails to come on, please move to a corridor located on an outside wall where there may be natural light from the windows. Wait in this area until you are given further instructions.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you must evacuate your area, safeguard your valuables and lock your desk.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			It is advisable to keep a small personal flashlight available to assist you in the remote chance of a blackout at night.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Telecommunications Systems Failure
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If there has been a general power failure in the College, the phone system will not function.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Subject to possible building interference, cell phones and two-way radio systems will continue to function.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In the event of complete failure of the phone system, the director of real estate operations may use the CBS Watchman Alert System to apprise the president, vice presidents, and senior director of marketing & public relations of the situation and coordinate a response to the situation.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Major System Failure
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Hazardous materials are substances that are either flammable or combustible, explosive, toxic, noxious, corrosive, oxidizable, an irritant, or radioactive. Some hazardous materials accidents will be minor and only involve the immediate evacuation of a site. Others may be large enough to necessitate relocating all students, staff, and other persons to either a safer location on campus or to an evacuation area away from the campus. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The nature, severity, and potential for health injury of the hazardous materials accident will determine the type of response required. Whatever the severity of the hazardous materials accident, College personnel should not attempt to take it upon themselves to remove a known or possibly hazardous chemical or substance. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Be aware of the chemical and avoid contamination. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Notify the Director of Real Estate Operations of type of spill if known and location of spill.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Isolate the area. Re-locate students/staff to safe areas if necessary. If necessary, follow evacuation procedures.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the nature of the chemical accident poses an immediate health hazard or potential for explosion or destruction of property, the Director of Real Estate Operations will notify 911 and will activate the CBS Watchman Alert System.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the substance should pose an ecological hazard by entering the storm drain system or by a major ground leak, we are required by law to immediately contact the authorities through 911.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Bio Hazard - Shelter-in-Place
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Shelter-in-place may be necessary due to chemical, biological, or radiological contaminants released accidentally or intentionally into the environment.  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If it is deemed safer to stay indoors versus evacuation, procedures are as follows:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Alert staff, faculty, and students via CBS Watchman Alert System.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Follow reverse evacuation procedures to bring all persons on campus indoors, if necessary.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not allow anyone to leave the campus.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Close and lock all windows, exterior doors, and any other openings to the outside.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If there is danger of explosion, close window blinds.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Turn off all fans, heating, and air conditioning systems.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Gather essential disaster supplies such as nonperishable food, bottled water, battery-powered radios, first aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, duct tape, plastic sheeting, and plastic garbage bags.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Select interior room(s) above the ground floor, with the fewest windows or vents, i.e., offices, large storage closets, utility rooms, and restrooms.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Bring everyone into the rooms. Shut and lock the doors. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Bio Hazard
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Severe Weather Conditions
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Flood 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Tornado
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Hurricane
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Should inclement weather arise where circumstances may impact the ability of CBS to conduct business in a normal fashion, CBS may suspend operations. Each emergency situation is unique and CBS reserves the right to alter this policy and issue specific procedures as dictated by circumstances.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			PROCEDURE:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A. If emergency or severe weather conditions develop, employees may leave who have good cause to believe that their safety or the safety of others in their household is at risk. Leaving must be coordinated with the department manager or supervisor to make sure that the employee’s work and work area have been adequately secured in accordance with the department’s emergency plans for protecting the work area.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			B. Department managers or designees will communicate any change in work schedules to employees. The decision to evacuate the facility will be addressed by the members of the executive team.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			C. The CBS Watchman Alert System will be utilized to disseminate necessary information to CBS faculty, staff, and students. This alert system will be utilized to notify local media outlets regarding campus closings and return to work notices as appropriate. The CBS phone system and website will be utilized as a notification system. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			D. During an emergency or other disaster, CBS buildings will not be available as a storm shelter. This is due to the unavailability of food, water, lighting, air circulation, sanitary facilities, and elevator service. A skeleton crew may or may not be in each building to secure the facilities and minimize potential damage, or to provide essential services.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			When a decision to dismiss classes or close the campus is made by leadership due to weather or other conditions posing a potentially serious threat to the health or safety of the College’s students and/or employees, the following procedures are presented as general guidelines.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			HURRICANE 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Full Alert/Evacuation: Declared by the mayor of Houston, means a hurricane is estimated to reach the area within 48 - 72 hours. Upon notification of mandatory evacuation by the city, or earlier based on other supporting guidance by other trusted agencies, CBS evacuation and shut down will be initiated.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The CBS campus will be fully evacuated and manually shut down.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The CBS campus water supply, electricity, and gas will be turned off.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All CBS campus entry points will be locked.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Access into the CBS campus will be denied until further notice.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Office Area Guidelines
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Turn off and unplug computers and other essential office equipment.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Move essential office equipment to protected areas. (Best location: Away from windows, preferably behind a protected wall.)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Move equipment off the floor.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Delicate, non-replaceable computer data storage media should be stored in a watertight secure container above the floor.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Place all loose papers and important documents in cabinets or files.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Lower and close all blinds.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Remove personal items as those are not covered under CBS insurance.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Employees check with immediate supervisor prior to leaving campus at completion of hurricane preparations.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Facilities and the IT department will carry out final technology & equipment preparations across campus.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			When weather is no longer an immediate threat, authorized CBS and Boxer employees will be allowed access to complete a full damage assessment of the buildings. Utility services and normal operations will be restored as soon as possible. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			TORNADO & THUNDER STORMS
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Thunderstorms can produce extreme and sudden winds which may also expose you to tornado-like weather hazards.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Seek shelter inside buildings or other secure locations. Avoid glass and exposure to flying debris.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Department heads should have a specific (take cover) area within their department identified, where all employees should meet that is clear of glass windows.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Move to the main or “take cover” areas. Assume a seated position on the floor with head down and hands over head, or place yourself under a desk or between fixed seating (if possible) with head lower than the back of the seat.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Hallways and stairwells away from glass are also acceptable shelters/take cover areas.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Once the hazard has stabilized, exit the building to an evacuation point.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Flooding
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Minor flooding around the campus or area flooding could be a result of major  rainstorms, a water main break, or loss of power to sump pumps. In the case of weather-related flooding, the crisis management team will monitor the National Weather Service and other emergency advisories to determine necessary action.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Flash Flooding
http://cbshouston.edu	span		span	Most flash flooding is caused by slow moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from severe storms. Alerts are issued by the 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			National Weather Service and are classified in two major categories. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Flood Watch
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 - Conditions are favorable for the development of floods. Many more WATCHES are issued than WARNINGS. A WATCH is the first sign a flood may occur, and when one is issued, you should be aware of potential flood hazards.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Flood Warning
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 - Flooding is occurring or is imminent in the area.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The rule for being safe in flood situations is simple: Head for higher ground and stay away from floodwaters. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Even a shallow depth of fast-moving flood water produces more force than most people imagine. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Turn around, don't drown. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The most dangerous thing you can do is to try walking, swimming, or driving through floodwaters. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Appropriate communication via CBS Watchman Alert System will be maintained with the campus community until the threat has passed.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you can safely do so, secure vital equipment, records, and hazardous materials and move items to a higher level. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Shut off all electrical equipment. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Wait for instructions from the crisis management team. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not return to your site until you have been instructed to do so via the CBS Watchman Alert System or a member of the crisis management team.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Report any oil, chemical, biological, radioactive materials, or food preparation areas suspected of mixing with the floodwaters to the director of real estate operations.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not dump floodwater down any drain (storm or sanitary) unless approved by facilities.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Flooded Area
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Be aware of the potential for electrical shock!
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 Wear rubber boots in wet areas. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Call facilities @ 713.545.8543 to turn off all main electrical switches and gas supplies. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not enter or allow anyone else to enter the building or space until circuits and equipment are tested and proven de-energized by qualified personnel from facilities. Do not turn power back on until appropriate repairs have been performed and electrical equipment has been inspected and approved by qualified electrical personnel.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Electrical equipment used in flooded areas must be protected with ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			After the main power is off, unplug electrical appliances and do not turn on any appliances that have become wet until they are checked for proper operation. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not use any open flame until the area has been ventilated for the potential presence of natural gas. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Precautions should be taken to prevent contact with any sewage and to isolate the area to prevent contaminants from being tracked to other parts of the building. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Occupants not involved in the cleanup must be evacuated from these areas when sewage is present. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Blizzard
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If indoors:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay calm and await instructions from the Emergency Coordinator or a designated official.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay indoors if possible.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If there is no heat:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Close off unneeded rooms or areas.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stuff towels or rags in cracks under doors.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Cover windows at night.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Eat and drink. Food provides the body with much needed energy and heat. Fluids prevent dehydration.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Wear layers of loose-fitting, light-weight, warm clothing, if available.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If outdoors:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Find a dry shelter. Cover all exposed parts of the body.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If shelter is not available:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Prepare a lean-to, windbreak, or snow cave for protection from the wind. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Build a fire for heat and to attract attention. Place rocks around the fire to absorb and reflect heat.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Do not eat snow unless you melt it first. It will lower your body temperature. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you are stranded in a vehicle:  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay in the vehicle!
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Run the motor about ten minutes each hour. Open the windows a little for fresh air to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Make sure the exhaust pipe is not blocked.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Make yourself visible to rescuers.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Turn on the dome light at night when running the engine.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Tie a colored cloth to your antenna or door. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Raise the hood after the snow stops falling.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Exercise to keep blood circulating and to keep warm.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Severe Weather & Flooding
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Please take a few moments to watch this video.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The safety and security of our staff, faculty, and students is our highest priority. It is our goal to prepare and educate the CBS community to the best of our ability for possible emergency situations. With the increase in active shooter/armed intruder incidents nationwide, we believe it is best to be prepared to handle an active shooter situation if it ever occurs in the future. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS strongly recommends viewing and becoming familiar with the tactics suggested in the “Run. Hide. Fight.” video. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span		span	An active shooter is a person who appears to be actively engaged in killing or attempting 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			to kill people in a populated area; in most cases active shooters use firearm(s) and there is no pattern or method to their selection of victims. These situations are dynamic and evolve rapidly, demanding immediate deployment of law enforcement resources to stop the shooting and mitigate harm to innocent victims. This document provides guidance to faculty, staff, and students who may be caught in an active shooter situation, and describes what to expect from responding police officers.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			We cannot predict the origin of the next threat; assailants in incidents across the nation have been students, staff, faculty, and others. In many cases, there were no obvious specific targets and the victims were unaware that they were a target until attacked. Being aware of your surroundings, taking common sense precautions, and heeding any warning information can help protect you and others on the campus.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Guidance to faculty, staff, and students:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In general, how you respond to an active shooter will be dictated by the specific circumstances of the encounter, bearing in mind there could be more than one shooter involved in the same situation. If you find yourself involved in an active shooter situation, try to remain calm and use these guidelines to help you plan a strategy for survival.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Active Shooter – Shelter-in-Place
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If an active shooter is outside the building:
http://cbshouston.edu	span		br	• Proceed to a room that can be locked. Close and lock all the windows and doors, and turn off all the lights. If possible, get everyone down on the floor and ensure that no one is visible from outside the room. One person in the room should call 911. Silence cell phones.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Advise the 911 dispatcher of what is taking place, and inform him/her of your location. Remain in place until the police or a campus administrator known to you, gives the “all clear” announcement. Unfamiliar voices may be the shooter attempting to lure victims from their safe space. Do not respond to any voice commands until you can verify with certainty they are being issued by a police officer.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If an active shooter is in the building:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Determine if the room you are in can be locked and if so, follow the same procedure described above. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• If you cannot lock the room, determine if there is a nearby location that you can reach safely and be secured, or if you can safely exit the building. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• If you cannot safely exit the room or building, quickly move to the same wall as the interior door, as far away from the door as possible. Quietly put something (desks, file cabinets, chairs, etc.) between you and the shooter. If several individuals are in the room, space yourselves apart to avoid becoming a “group” target for the shooter. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Refrain from creating any loud noises, and place your cell phone on silent mode so it does not ring audibly and reveal your location. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• If you decide to move from your current location, follow the instructions outlined below. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If an active shooter enters your office or classroom:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Try to remain calm. Dial 911.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Alert police to the shooter’s location; if you cannot speak, leave the line open so the dispatcher can listen to what is taking place. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Attempting to overpower the shooter with force should be considered a very last resort after all other options have been exhausted. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• If the shooter leaves the area, proceed immediately to a safer place and do not touch anything that was in the vicinity of the shooter.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you decide to flee during an active shooter situation:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Make sure you have an escape route and plan in mind. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Do not attempt to carry anything while fleeing.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Move quickly, keep your hands visible and follow the instructions of any police officers you may encounter. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Do not attempt to remove injured people; instead, leave wounded victims where they are, and notify authorities of their location as soon as possible. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			• Do not try to drive off campus until advised it is safe to do so by police or College administrators.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What to expect from responding police officers:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Police officers responding to an active shooter are trained in “rapid deployment” procedures and proceed immediately to the area in which shots were last heard; their purpose is to stop the shooting as quickly as possible. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The first responding officers will normally be in teams of four (4); they may be dressed in regular patrol uniforms, or they may be wearing external bulletproof vests, Kevlar helmets, and other tactical equipment. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span		strong	The officers may be armed with rifles, shotguns, or handguns, and might be using pepper spray or tear gas to control the situation. Regardless of how they appear, remain calm, do as the officers tell you, and do not be afraid of them. Put down any bags or packages you may be carrying and 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			keep your hands visible at all times
http://cbshouston.edu	span			.  If you know where the shooter is, tell the officers. Be aware as you are attempting to exit the area. Responding officers may not recognize you, and may need to confirm
http://cbshouston.edu	span			your identity before allowing you to proceed. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The first officers to arrive will not stop to aid injured people; rescue teams composed of other officers and emergency medical personnel will follow the first officers into secured areas to treat and remove injured persons. Keep in mind that even once you have escaped to a safer location, the entire area is still a crime scene. Police will usually not let anyone leave until the situation is fully under control and all witnesses have been identified and questioned. Until you are released, remain at whatever assembly point authorities designate. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Training videos are offered on our website to be viewed anytime. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In coordination with the Houston Police Department and Houston Fire Department, CBS conducts scheduled drills to simulate an on-campus active shooter. These drills will not only prepare CBS staff and faculty, but will also allow the HPD and HFD to familiarize themselves with the layout of our campus should they ever need to answer such a call.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Active Shooter Information
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In the event of a fire, the alarm should be activated and evacuation of the building begun. If possible, locate a fire extinguisher and extinguish the fire.  If unable, a 911 call should be made immediately. Ensure the evacuation of the building has taken place.  The CBS crisis management and emergency procedures will go into effect at this time.  
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			IF YOU ENCOUNTER SMOKE OR FLAMES: 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Crawl low under the smoke to get to clean air areas. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Test the door before opening by kneeling or crouching at the door. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Reach up as high as you can and touch the door and knob with the back of your hand. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the door is hot, use another escape route. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the door is cool, open it cautiously and continue along your escape route. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Isolate fire by closing off doors if possible.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Follow the evacuation route as outlined on the fire escape map located in each room of the building.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you are on a second floor, evacuate using stairwells. Do not use the elevators.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Follow directions from those in authority. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Stay calm.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Once you are safe and the immediate emergency procedures have been followed, notify your vice president or the director of real estate operations. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Fire Drill
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS expects all employees to be prepared for a fire and have the ability to assist any student and visitors. The steps are listed below: 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			1. Fire drills are both announced and unannounced and held at least once a year.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			2. Everyone on campus is expected to participate.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			3. Each class has a visible fire escape map. Take the exit that is assigned to your classroom, suite, or department.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			4. All students and staff are advised to take anything of personal value during the fire drill. Doors must be closed and locked.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			5. Running is not permissible while exiting the building.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			6. Do not stand close to the building while waiting for clearance to re-enter the premises. Everyone should find a safe location away from the vehicles.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			7. All rooms are checked for clearance.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			8. The fire drill will usually last 5-8 minutes. Everyone will be permitted to enter the building once the alarm stops sounding.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			9. Special care and emphasis is on our students that are in wheel chairs or have other handicap needs.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act
http://cbshouston.edu	span			As described by the Clery Center for Security on Campus: The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act represents a turning point in our nation’s handling of sexual misconduct on college campuses and universities. SaVE Act seeks to address the violence women face on campus: the highest rates of stalking, the highest risk of nonfatal intimate partner violence, and 20-25% of female students experiencing rape or attempted rape.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies – Houston is committed to maintaining a safe learning and work environment for all students, faculty, and staff and is committed to the elimination of sexual violence in all forms and will take appropriate action against any individual found responsible for acts in violation of this policy. Acts of sexual violence may also constitute violations of criminal and civil law that may require separate proceedings. To further its commitment against sexual violence, CBS provides reporting options, an investigative and disciplinary process, and prevention training and other related services as appropriate.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Receiving a Financial Aid Refund
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Once your financial aid funds have been credited to your student account, your financial aid will first be used to pay your current tuition, fees, and bookstore charges (if applicable). If your financial aid exceeds your total current charges, your student account will show a credit balance and CBS will refund the remaining amount to you.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			My financial aid is more than my CBS charges – when will I receive a refund?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Once your financial aid has paid for your tuition, fees, bookstore charges, etc., any remaining financial aid will be refunded to you accordingly by paper check. Once your disbursements has credited to your account please allow 7 to 14 business days before a refund is issued.    
http://cbshouston.edu	em			PLEASE NOTE:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 The U.S. Department of Education requires that your refund be available to you within 14 days of the date it was disbursed to your student account. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Why does it take so long after the semester starts to receive a refund?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In order to maximize the flexibility of your class schedule, CBS allows all students to add, drop, or adjust your classes up to the census date each semester.  At the same time, federal financial aid rules require CBS to confirm you are attending/participating in your classes before disbursing any excess refunds.  In order to avoid disbursing aid to you incorrectly, CBS will process refund checks within the 7-14 days period after receipt of your federal funds are added to your student account and your final enrollment/charges for the semester are process.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Who should I contact for questions about the status of my financial aid?

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Replacement Checks

http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	Contact Student Accounts at: 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Provide appropriate written documentation of the circumstances to support the request
http://cbshouston.edu	span			To generate a replacement check, CBS will be required to stop payment. CBS charges a $30 processing fee for each stopped payment.
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	"If it was an action of CBS that resulted in the need for a replacement check, the student's account will not be assessed the ""Stop Payment"" fee. CBS is not responsible if the check was sent to the current address listed on the student's record. Students are responsible for updating their mailing address via "

http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Bible Certificate Program
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Doctrinal Statement 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The doctrinal position of the College of Biblical Studies is historically that of conservative Christianity. CBS rests firmly upon the integrity and inerrancy of the Holy Scriptures and, therefore, wholeheartedly accepts the basic doctrines of the historic Protestant Christian faith. CBS also supports the non-charismatic, dispensational, pre-millennial movement. Traditionally, CBS graduates stand for these great truths, and it is the desire of the College to continue to provide personnel for service in these ranks. This Doctrinal Statement, which every board member, administrator, staff and faculty member must sign, also includes:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Every word in the original writings of the Holy Scriptures is inspired of God and without error (2 Tim. 3:16; 2 Pet. 1:21; 1 Cor. 2:13).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Godhead exists eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one God (Gen. 1:1; Jn. 10:30, 4:24; Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Man was created in the image and likeness of God, but in Adam all mankind fell into sin with the result that all men are sinners, hopelessly sinful in themselves, apart from the grace of God (Gen. 1:27, 9:6; Rom. 5:12, 3:23; Eph. 2:1).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Eternal Son of God became incarnate in the Lord Jesus Christ, who is true God and true man, having been born of the virgin Mary (Jn. 1:1, 14, 18; Matt. 1:21 23; Heb. 1:6, 8; 1 Jn. 5:20; 1 Tim. 2:5).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Salvation is received by faith alone in Christ, who died in substitutionary sacrifice for our sins and rose again (Acts 4:12; 13:38, 39; 1 Cor. 15:1 4; Rom. 4:4, 5; 5:1). 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Every true believer is promised positional and ultimate sanctification with the possibility of progressive development in life spiritually (progressive sanctification) (Heb. 10:10, 14; Jn. 17:17; Eph. 5:26, 27; 1 Thess. 4:3, 4; 1 Jn. 3:2).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All who are born of the Spirit through faith in Christ can have the assurance of salvation and are eternally secure in Christ (Rom. 5:1; Jn. 3:5, 6; 1 Jn. 5:13; Jn. 10:28, 29; 17:12; 2 Tim. 1:12).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Holy Spirit is the Third Person of the Godhead, who regenerates, indwells, baptizes and seals all true believers in Christ and fills those yielded to God (Matt. 28:19; Jn. 1:13; 3:3 6; Titus 3:5; 1 Cor. 2:12; 6:19; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 12:13; Eph. 4:30).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The Church, embracing all true believers, is the body and bride of Christ, formed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit (Eph. 1:22, 23; 5:24, 25, 30; 1 Cor. 12:12, 13, 27).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Christians are called to a holy life of service and testimony in the power of the Holy Spirit, which service includes the propagation of the Gospel message to the whole world. There is promised reward in heaven for faithfulness in such service (1 Pet. 1:15, 16; Jn. 12:25, 26; Acts 1:8; 1 Cor. 3:12 15).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The scriptural ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s Supper are for all true believers in Christ (Matt. 28:19, 20; Mk. 16:15, 16; Acts 8:12, 36 38; 9:18; 10:47; 1 Cor. 1:16; 11:23 26).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Angels were originally created holy but now exist as unfallen and fallen including Satan (Col. 1:16; Neh. 9:6; Ps. 143:2 5; Jude 6; Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:9; Eph. 6:11, 12).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			God has revealed different dispensations or stewardships with corresponding rules of life, of which the present dispensation is the age of grace (Eph. 3:2 6, 9 11; Col. 1:25 27; Rom. 6:14; Heb. 7:18, 19).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The imminent return of the Lord, which is the blessed hope of the Church, is to be followed in order by: the tribulation; the establishment of the reign of Christ on earth for one thousand years; the eternal state of punishment for the unsaved and the eternal state of blessing for the saved (Titus 2:13; 1 Thess. 1:10; 4:13 18; 5:4 10; Rev. 3:10; Matt. 24:21, 29, 30; 25:31; Rev. 20:1 6, 11 15; Matt. 25:46).

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Course Cancellation
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If a class is cancelled by the institution prior to class starting date, 100% of tuition and applicable fees for the particular course will be refunded. A change in the scheduled professor does not constitute a cancellation and will not entitle the student to a refund.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Course Change Requests
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Official notice of course change requests must be submitted by the student according to the published refund schedule in order to qualify for any tuition refunds. Tuition refund percentages are calculated based on the submission date of the Add/Drop form or Voluntary Withdrawal form. Any debt owed by the student and/or any refund due to the student will be determined upon receipt of official notice. Adjustments will be made to tuition charges and fees which are considered refundable and are designated in the tuition and fee schedule.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Return of Institutional Aid and Scholarships: 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Institutional aid and scholarships are awarded based on enrollment hours. If any student withdraws from the College or reduces the number of hours during the course of the term, his/her awards will be adjusted accordingly, and as a result, he/she may owe the institution. CBS does not refund institutional aid or scholarships to students.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Refund Schedule
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	The refund schedule that follows assumes that all applicable charges were paid in full prior to the withdrawal. Otherwise, the student may actually owe a balance to CBS. Proceeds originating from refunds that are in excess of all student account charges (tuition, fees and other related expenses) will be mailed to the student. Students should maintain their current address and contact information online at 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Note: The following refund schedule differs from the Department of Education and other financial aid refund policies. Students who are receiving financial aid under Title IV or other financial aid programs should also consult the Title IV refund policies in this catalog or contact Student Financial Services for details.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			“Days” in the following refund schedule refer to the number of days since the first scheduled class day of the term according to the academic calendar.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Return of Title IV Funds
http://cbshouston.edu	span			For any student who officially or unofficially withdraws from the College or fails to earn a passing grade in any class, federal regulations require a refund calculation for all students receiving Federal Title IV Funds. The calculation of the return of these funds may result in your owing a balance to CBS. If unpaid balances exist on your account, a hold will be placed on your student record. Withdrawing from classes will impact your Satisfactory Academic Progress and may cause you to be ineligible for future financial aid. All students should visit with a financial aid advisor prior to withdrawing.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Refunds and repayments of Title IV funds are made in the following order:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Unsubsidized Stafford Loan
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Subsidized Stafford Loan
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Federal PLUS Loans
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Pell Grants
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Academic Competitiveness Grant
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The amount of federal aid that you must repay is determined via the Federal Formula for Return of Title IV funds (Section 484B of the Higher Education Act). This law also specifies the order in which funds are to be returned to the financial aid programs from which they were awarded, starting with loan programs. In addition, institutional aid that is awarded may be affected due to withdrawals. Please be sure to consult with Student Financial Services before deciding to withdraw.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Returned Checks
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	There may be situations where a student will need to request a replacement check for a student account credit refund check that was lost or destroyed. The student should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 to request the replacement check and provide appropriate written documentation of the circumstances to support the request.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			"To generate a replacement check, CBS will be required to stop payment (CBS will be charged a fee by the financial institution) on the original check prior to issuing a replacement check. The respective fee will be charged on the student's account as a ""Stop Payment"" transaction and the replacement check will reflect the adjusted credit balance on the account. If it was an action of CBS that resulted in the need for a replacement check, the student's account will not be assessed the ""Stop Payment' fee. CBS is not responsible if the check was sent to the current address listed on the student's record. Students are responsible for updating their mailing address in MyRecords using their student login."
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS offers online payments for those who qualify. There is no minimum amount to start the plan. A selection of payment plan options can be made through Nelnet Business Solutions.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			This is not a loan program so interest and finance charges are not assessed. Monthly payments will be automatically drafted or deducted on the 5th of the month according to the payment plan agreement you choose. You are encouraged to register early to allow for a wider selection of payment plans.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS will now offer book allowances maximum of $300 beginning Fall 2013 to students who meet the following criteria:
http://cbshouston.edu	span	br		• Student must be Pell eligible and have a credit balance on their account. This will include all FSA funds (Example Student loans) 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	br		• All financial aid documents must be completed and ready for disbursement 10 days prior to the first start of class  
http://cbshouston.edu	span	br		• $300 dollars will be mailed out the student starting the first week of class  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If you are eligible for the Pell Grant, register early, and have funds remaining after tuition/fees are deducted, the CBS Office of Financial Aid will process a book allowance for you. This book charge authorization is not part of your Pell Grant. It is a short term loan from CBS as a courtesy to help defray expenses until Pell Grant awards can be processed and may not cover the total cost of your books. Book allowances will be mailed the first week of classes. This allowance will be deducted from your Pell Grant award before refunds are made. If you wish to decline the book allowances you must do so in writing. If you are eligible for a loan or Pell Grant and did not register in time for a book allowance you must contact the Office of Financial Aid to see if you are eligible to have one processed.

http://cbshouston.edu	a			Please click here for the CBS Placement Testing Policy and Testing Waiver
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Exams and Placement Testing
http://cbshouston.edu	span			PURPOSE:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			This policy sets forth the categories of admission once an applicant has met admission requirements through the Admission Office. This policy will also establish the guidelines for which the Applicant will be exempt from the required assessments.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			POLICY:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Admission decisions are to be honored by the College for three semesters after the semester for which the individual applied. Applicants seeking admission into the college must meet the requirements set forth in one of the following categories:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Unconditional Admission
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students who have met all of the requirements listed below will be unconditionally admitted to the College:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A completed Application for Admission
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Receipt of application fee
http://cbshouston.edu	span			An approved, unexpired form of photo identification (driver’s license, passport, permanent residency ID, consulate ID, etc.)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Official copy of high school transcript* showing the date of graduation, official copy of high school transcript showing the date of graduation or GED, if required.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Official transcripts from all colleges/universities where the applicant was previously enrolled. (The inability to provide all college transcripts may result in a denial of admission.)
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Passing scores on placement testing (if required).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Conditional Admission
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Non-high school graduates (excluding dual credit students, may be admitted based on special admission requirements provided that the student has the ability to benefit from college- level instruction. Applicants seeking admission under this category must have completed their sophomore year of high school or be beyond the age of compulsory attendance (18 years old in the state of Texas). Non-high school graduate applicants will be:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			required to complete entrance testing
http://cbshouston.edu	span			restricted from entering degree programs
http://cbshouston.edu	span			ineligible for federal and state aid, grants and loans.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Upon analysis of student academic ability, applicants will be required to take Gateway (Developmental) courses.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Non-Degree Seeking Students
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All students who have not applied to a degree program will be classified as “non-degree seeking.” Non-degree students may enroll for a maximum of 15 credit hours, provided that they have met all individual course prerequisite requirements. Hours taken via audit do not count towards the 15-hour maximum. Neither institutional nor federal aid is available to non-degree students. Admission requirements are the same for these students, with the exception that unofficial college/university transcripts and a copy of a high school diploma may be submitted in lieu of official transcripts until they apply for admission into a program. Students who desire to continue beyond the maximum of 15 credits should contact their Academic Advisor regarding program entry. Courses taken as a non-degree student may apply to a degree program according to the degree requirements at the time of application to the degree program.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			International Students
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS admits non-US citizen, international students to online degree programs only. CBS does not currently 
http://cbshouston.edu	span	span		grant admission to individuals requiring an I-20 form or anyone who is in the United States on a visa.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			International students are required to complete the international student application and pay any international 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			application fees, exchange rates, or other transaction costs. Non-native English-speaking, international students applying to online programs will be required to demonstrate English proficiency through submission of TOEFL scores. All other admissions policies apply.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Provisional Admission
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students who meet the admissions requirements, but provides an unofficial prior college transcript may be admitted provisionally to the college. They can attend one semester without the official transcript, but must provide the official transcript before they can continue. A Registrar hold will be placed on their account.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			GPA (Grade Point Average)
http://cbshouston.edu	span		em	There are two grade point averages that are relevant to your academic standing. Your 
http://cbshouston.edu	em			semester grade point average
http://cbshouston.edu	span		em	 is the average of your grades for any one given semester of your college career. Your

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Marvin McNeese Jr. has been teaching at CBS since the fall of 2004.  Following an interest in politics that God awakened in his youth, Marvin’s professional experience regularly had him serving in financial administration while serving the Lord.  His training in political science and economics began at Albion College in Michigan, and continued at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and the Teresa Lorenzo Long Institute of Latin American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin, where he earned two Master Degrees.  He earned his Ph.D. in Political Science from Rice University.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Marvin married his college sweetheart (much later) and they have four children.  Most of his career has been spent in higher education, though He has helped several churches to develop and raise funds for their social service and charitable activities.  Marvin highly values international missions, having served as a missionary to Panama, and has participated in other short mission trips to Brazil, Honduras and the Philippines. Committed to serving through the local body, he is a deacon at Houston’s First Baptist Church.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Marvin is Chair for the General Education Department and has served as a grant writer in the Development Department.  He has a passion for helping believers take up God’s challenge to meet social needs in Jesus’ name and to participate in government based on biblical principles.  His coursework clearly explains, according to the scriptures, the relevance and rightful place of government in our lives and a Christians’ responsibility in light of this.

http://cbshouston.edu	h2	ul		Bio
http://cbshouston.edu	span			I was born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin to a strong Christian family. My father was the General Manager of a large Christian radio station (WWIB). I was led to Christ by my mother when I was five years old and baptized when I was nine. In 1978, my father was asked to start a Christian radio station in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We moved to Lancaster and that is where I spent my formative years. I went to Lancaster Christian School, graduating in 1986. I then went to Lancaster Bible College, graduating in 1990. Shortly after graduation, I started a college-age Bible study group in my home church. The thing just took off and many encouraged me in my teaching ability. However, it soon became apparent that if I was going to teach the Bible then I needed further education. I decided to go to Dallas Theological Seminary. Into my Bible study class one day walked a ravishing redhead named Kimberley and we soon fell in love. We were married on July 23, 1994 and immediately moved to Dallas.
http://cbshouston.edu	p			Initially, I went to DTS to get the Th.M. degree. However, during my senior year several professors encouraged me to go into the doctoral program. I entered the program after graduating with my Th.M. in 1996. I worked my way through the program by teaching at Dallas Christian College and by serving as a Teaching Assistant for the Bible Exposition department at DTS. In 1999, the department gave me the opportunity to teach a course on my own and I have been a steady adjunct for them ever since (I usually teach one or two classes a semester for DTS at the various extensions and at the main campus).
http://cbshouston.edu	p			In 2000, CBS asked me to move to Houston and help start their Bachelor’s degree program. I have been a full-time professor at CBS ever since. I am now the Department Chair for both Bible and Theology. After finishing my dissertation in 2001 I decided to write some commentaries. I started the Loken Exposition Commentary series and have published three volumes to date. I am also writing a series of introductions on the various segments of the Bible (i.e., Pentateuch, History, Poetry, Prophecy, etc.). My only real goals in life are to teach God’s Word on the College and Seminary level and write books that will help students learn the Bible. I am living my dream. My wife and I currently live in Tomball, Texas. We do not have any children but we have more than enough pets to make up for it!

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Alex was born in El Salvador, Central America. He is the youngest of six siblings and has lived in the US since the age of eight. In the spring of his senior year of High School, he placed his faith in Jesus Christ as his sole and sufficient savior. Upon completing high school, Alex joined the US Military and served in the Army four years. He was deployed to South Korea and Bosnia while in the Army. It was during his time in Bosnia, Herzegovina that he sensed God leading him into full-time ministry.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			His formal education began after his four-year commitment in the US Army in 1999 at the University of Houston-Downtown. Shortly thereafter, Alex was introduced to the College of Biblical Studies where he would complete a Bachelor of Science in Christian Leadership (2003). He also served in a Hispanic Ministry as the Youth Pastor. His responsibilities included teaching weekly and mid-week Bible Studies, counseling and discipling youth along with planning youth events.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			After completing his studies at CBS, Alex and his wife Marisol moved to Dallas to pursue a Master of Theology (Th.M) at Dallas Theological Seminary. During seminary, Alex served as Youth Pastor at Arlington Hispanic Bible Church, Iglesia Bíblica El Buen Pastor, and as a Hispanic Ministry Intern at Stonebriar Community Church. His responsibilities included teaching weekly and mid- week Bible studies, counseling and discipling youth and leading small groups, and on occasion pulpit ministry. He and his wife were also the interpreters for a missionary team from Sugarland, TX going to Honduras, Central America. While completing his studies at Dallas Seminary, Alex was contacted by CBS and was offered a job as full-time faculty. This led Alex and Marisol back home to Houston in the spring of 2007.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Back in Houston, Alex continued his ministry to youth and young adults at Crossover Bible Fellowship (2007-2009). Alex completed a Master of Arts in Biblical Studies in December 2007 and a Master of Theology in May 2010. He is the founder and lead pastor of Gracia Abundante - Abounding Grace.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Alex has been married to Marisol since December 2001 and they have one daughter, Alexia Marie, and three sons, Caleb, Lucas, and Silas.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			As a nine-year-old, Dr. Fisher sat under the Sunday school teaching of his grandfather, where he came to saving faith in Christ. Dr. Fisher’s mother taught for the Houston Independent School District, one of many family members involved in education. Ironically, Dr. Fisher resisted the insistence of his mother that he attend college. However, her persistence paid off and Dr. Fisher realized the precious value of education – so much so that he too became an educator.­
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Dr. Fisher’s educational career afforded him several cherished milestones, not the least of which was being named the Spring Virtual High School Teacher of the Year (2009), KPRC Channel 2 Houston, TX Teacher of the Month (2009), Spring Independent School District Teacher of the Year, 2008-09, and recognized by Harris County Region 4 as Teacher of the Year in 2009. He was nominated (by his peers) and was inducted into the Delta Epsilon Chi Honor Society for Biblical Higher Education for his intellectual achievement, Christian character, and leadership ability. He also received an Outstanding Online Faculty Award Nomination from Colorado Christian University, 2015. Teaching computer skills to young people also provided an avenue for his Christian worldview. Having grown up in the church, Dr. Fisher developed a genuine desire to serve the Lord and recognized that the Lord calls every believer to ministry, not just the pastors and elders.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			As a member of the first graduating bachelors class at the College of Biblical Studies (Biblical Studies, 2002), Dr. Fisher felt ecstatic when Dr. Joe Parle, Academic Dean and Vice President of Academic Affairs, invited him to become a CBS faculty member. Dr. Fisher remarked, “I am so blessed to have the opportunity to teach at CBS where I had been so impacted as a student. I truly believe that the degree I received from CBS prepared me to have the God-honoring discipline to make it through my (three) Masters Degrees and doctorate.” Dr. Fisher enjoys bringing his zeal for teaching, for ministry and for computer technology together at the School where it all started for him.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Dr. Fisher has been teaching and developing online graduate level courses at various institutions including Colorado Christian University, North Greenville University, and American College of Education, where he serves as a dissertation committee member. Presently, Dr. Fisher is a member of Lily Grove Missionary Baptist Church where he is one of several preachers who serve as a Sunday School teacher for the ministers’ class and Awana for middle school students.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			He has been married to his beautiful wife, Kym for twenty-four years. They have three kids, Brittani, Nicholas, and Sydnee. In the midst of all of this, Dr. Fisher's greatest joy is looking back and seeing how God has sovereignly orchestrated the details of his life. The young man who didn't want to go to college honors his mother by obeying the call of the Father!

http://cbshouston.edu	strong	span		Student Rights
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies is committed to respecting all members of our community and providing a quality educational experience for all students. Students have the right to file a formal written complaint in reference to academic and institutional functions, personnel, or other members of the College community.  The objective of the Formal Student Complaint Policy and Procedure is to ensure that the concerns and complaints of students are addressed fairly and are resolved promptly.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Written student complaints, addressed in the manner specified below, will be handled responsively and follow the procedures stated below. The concerns and complaints of students will be addressed fairly and will be resolved promptly.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Complaints related to this policy are usually the result of behavior that the student feels is unjust, inequitable, or creates an unnecessary hardship.  Students may file complaints following this policy if they believe a problem is not governed by other CBS complaint or appeal procedures or if they have exhausted those procedures. Examples of these other procedures not governed by this policy include:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Academic Appeals including:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			                Academic Suspension/Dismissal
http://cbshouston.edu	span			                Satisfactory Academic Progress
http://cbshouston.edu	span			                Grade Appeal
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Financial Aid Appeals including:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			                General Refund Policy
http://cbshouston.edu	span			ADA Accommodation Requests
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Discrimination Complaints
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Sexual Harassment Complaints
http://cbshouston.edu	a			Official Student Complaint Form
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Formal Student Complaint Procedures are as follows:
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	1. Whenever possible, students are encouraged to seek an informal resolution of the matter directly with the faculty or individual/s involved. Following 
http://cbshouston.edu	a			Matthew 18:15-17
http://cbshouston.edu	span			, offenses against one another should be corrected by the individuals involved (e.g., the student with the complaint should first privately address the offending student, faculty or staff member to resolve the issue). Although the preference is for these matters to initially be dealt with privately, an individual may request a CBS administrator to be present at the initial discussion if the party is concerned about the response of the other individual.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			2. Often a complaint can be resolved in this way. However, if an informal approach is neither successful nor advisable, the student should use the following procedure. If there is no resolution to the institutional complaint per item #1, a student may complete a Formal Student Complaint Form; forms are available in the Office of the Dean of Students. When filing a complaint, it is important that all documentation and other evidence associated with the complaint (e.g., witness statements and support documentation) be included. More than one complaint can be filed regarding the same incident. The complaint form will be considered complete only when it is submitted by the complainant.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			3. The complaint will be forwarded to the Dean of Students for review, investigation, and resolution. The Dean of Students will notify the student in writing of the final decision within ten business days of the date of the initial complaint and include the notice of a right to appeal.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			4. The student has the right to appeal the decision of the Dean of Students to the Vice President of Student and Enrollment Services within ten business days of the date of the written notice of the Dean of Student’s decision. 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong	span		Academic Complaints
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The procedures for addressing academic complaints including, but not limited to, faculty members and grades are as follows:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			1.     Following Matthew 18:15-17, offenses against one another should be corrected by the individuals involved (e.g., the student with the complaint should first privately address the offending student, faculty or staff member to resolve the issue). Although the preference is for these matters to initially be dealt with privately, an individual may request a CBS administrator to be present at the initial discussion if the party is concerned about the response of the other individual.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			2.     If there is no resolution to an academic complaint, the student should address the matter in writing to the Academic Dean within 120 days of the alleged incident. In some situations, both the Academic Dean and the Dean of Students will meet with the student.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			3.     If the complaint involves a disagreement between a student and a faculty member, the Faculty Committee may be consulted at the discretion of the Academic Dean. In the event that they are consulted, the Faculty Committee will be the final arbiter in disputes regarding assigned grades as well as any other complaint for which they are consulted. Since the Faculty Committee is the final arbiter, there is no appeal beyond their decision. [

http://cbshouston.edu	strong	span		Sexual Violence
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies is committed to maintaining a safe learning and work environment for all students, faculty and staff. Any form of exploitation, intimidation and harassment, including sexual harassment will not be tolerated, and is prohibited by law and our institution’s policy. We believe that education is the most effective way to reinforce this commitment and to create a harassment-free environment. CBS recognizes that all who work and learn at the College are responsible for ensuring that the community is free from discrimination based on sex or gender, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, other forms of sexual misconduct, stalking and intimate-partner violence. These behaviors threaten our learning, living and work environments and will not be tolerated.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			College students or employees who experience conduct in violation of this policy are likely to have concerns and questions, including how to report and respond to sex-based misconduct. Title IX complaints by or against CBS students, employees, or third parties, can be filed with the Title IX Coordinator. To discuss concerns or report violations, please contact the Title IX Coordinator:

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Counseling
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students are offered opportunities to secure assistance concerning personal, spiritual and academic life. The Academic Dean and Dean of Students as well as faculty and staff are available to students. Additional assistance may be obtained through various external resources should there be a need for specialized intervention. For your convenience, the Dean of Students maintains a list of approved Christian Counselors.

http://cbshouston.edu	strong	span		Plagiarism
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Plagiarism is taking another person’s ideas and presenting them as one’s own or re-submitting work from another course without the faculty member’s permission. If someone else’s thoughts are used, credit must be given to that individual within the text and/or by a citation.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students should feel responsible for assisting in the maintenance of Christian standards. Students should report acts of academic dishonesty to the professor and help foster a healthy spiritual atmosphere among the student body. Covering up such dishonorable practices is detrimental to the best spiritual atmosphere among the members of the CBS family.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			It is the responsibility of the student to be fully informed about the College’s Academic Integrity policy. Lack of knowledge regarding the Academic Integrity policy is not a sufficient basis for appealing disciplinary action.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			All initial incidents of academic dishonesty will result in a grade of “F” on the assignment in question, and may subject the student to course failure.  Consequently, the incident will be reported to the Academic Dean. Subsequent incidents will result in disciplinary action by the Dean of Students and possible expulsion from the College. In this circumstance, the student has the right to appeal.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the [Name of postsecondary institution (“School”)] receives a request for access.  A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect.  The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.  If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy rights under FERPA.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A student who wishes to ask the school to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed, and specify why it should be changed.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			If the school decides not to amend the record as requested, the school will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student’s right to a hearing re­garding the request for amendment.  Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The right to provide written consent before the university discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without con­sent. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The school discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests.  A school official is a person employed by the [School] in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law en­forcement unit personnel and health staff); a person serving on the board of trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance com­mittee.  A school official also may include a volunteer or contractor outside of the [School] who performs an institutional service of function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees and who is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of PII from education records, such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent or a student volunteering to assist another school official in performing his or her tasks.  A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educa­tion record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the [School].
http://cbshouston.edu	span			[Optional] Upon request, the school also discloses education records without consent to offi­cials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. [NOTE TO POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION:  FERPA requires a school to make a reasonable attempt to notify each student of these disclosures unless the school states in its annual notification that it intends to forward records on request.]
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the [School] to comply with the requirements of FERPA.  The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Family Policy Compliance Office

http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Deadlines
http://cbshouston.edu	span		a	Students who wish to drop a course should first determine if the change would have an impact on their enrollment status, financial support, or academic standing and progress. Students are strongly encouraged to consult their 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 in advance. Students should refer to the published refund policy located on the Financial Aid website. A completed official “Add/ Drop Form” is required and is available from the Office of the Registrar. Failure to drop a course properly will result in a grade of “F” being recorded on the academic record. A registered student must drop a course before 25% of the class is completed, otherwise a “W” will appear on the transcript. Courses cannot be dropped after 70% of the class is completed. All course weeks and dates for online classes are determined by the Attendance Policy for online courses.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Procedures
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Before dropping individual courses, consult with your advisor and financial aid advisor to determine if:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Your course drop will delay your completing your academic requirements as set by you and your advisor.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Your reduced course load would jeopardize your financial aid status

http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about CBS Academic Programs by Campus
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Academics
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. When should I apply for financial aid? 
http://cbshouston.edu	p			 Students can apply as early as October for the upcoming academic year.
http://cbshouston.edu	p			Students applying for financial aid from CBS must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and complete the MyFA Financial Aid Application.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. What is your Title IV School Code?
http://cbshouston.edu	p			 Our Federal School Code is 034224.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. What is an EFC (Expected Family Contribution)?
http://cbshouston.edu	p			The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is a calculated figure based on the information you report on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The calculation is made through a need analysis formula established by the U.S. Congress. While the EFC seems mysterious, it is based on a preset formula that, in the case of Federal financial aid, is set by law. The EFC formula takes into account:
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Income 
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Assets 
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Employment benefits 
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Family size 
http://cbshouston.edu	li			Number of family members in college
http://cbshouston.edu	p	ul	strong	The calculated Expected Family Contribution 
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			doesn’t necessarily equal what you’ll be expected to pay to the College.
http://cbshouston.edu	p	ul		 At CBS, we use the EFC to determine your eligibility for need-based Federal, state and institutional grants and scholarships. We do this by subtracting the EFC from the estimated Cost of Attendance (COA). If the number is positive, you are eligible for need-based aid up to that amount. If your EFC is greater than your COA, you are not eligible for need-based aid but may be eligible for non-need based student and parent loans.
http://cbshouston.edu	li			COA minus EFC equals Need-Based Eligibility
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. Is the Cost of Attendance what I owe?
http://cbshouston.edu	p			No. The only Cost of Attendance items paid directly to the College are tuition/fees and on-campus room and board if you choose to live on-campus. The Cost of Attendance is just an estimate and includes ALL expenses to attend the College for one year, not just expenses paid directly to CBS. The COA includes average tuition/fees, books and supplies, room and board, personal expenses, transportation expenses and a health insurance allowance and varies depending on whether you live on-campus, off-campus or at-home with relatives. Your actual expenses may be different and most items are not paid directly to the College.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. I don’t think I qualify for financial aid. Should I complete the FAFSA? 
http://cbshouston.edu	p			Yes! Financial aid is intended both to remove financial barriers for families who cannot afford the cost of an education beyond high school and to fill in the gap for families who can afford only part of the cost. A number of factors in addition to family income are considered in determining your financial eligibility, including the size of your family and number of family members in college. Although most grant awards are based on financial need, some loans and scholarships are available regardless of need.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			 Q. Don’t only students with the best grades qualify for financial aid?
http://cbshouston.edu	p			"No. There are scholarships that are ""merit-based,"" awarded on a student's academic performance. However, most financial aid, including grants and loans, is ""need-based,"" or awarded based on a family's ability to pay for college."
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. Must I be accepted for admission before I apply for financial aid? Must I be admitted before I receive aid?
http://cbshouston.edu	p			No. You may apply for financial aid any time after January 1st. However, you must be admitted and enrolled in a degree program at CBS before you receive any funds.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. Do I have to apply for financial aid each year? 
http://cbshouston.edu	p			Yes. Your financial situation must be reassessed each year. However, after the first year you apply for financial aid, you probably will be sent a Renewal FAFSA Application that will ask you to answer some questions again and recheck the answers to others.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. I want to apply for a scholarship only. Do I have to fill out the FAFSA? 
http://cbshouston.edu	p			Yes. In order to be considered for CBS institutional scholarship where financial need is part of the criteria, you must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). We recommend that every student fill out a FAFSA.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. If my parents save money for college, will it hurt my chances of qualifying for grants? 
http://cbshouston.edu	p			"The amount in a parent's savings account is indeed used in the federal formula that determines the contribution expected from parents. However, a large portion of those savings are ""protected"" from consideration; only a small percentage of the remaining amount is assessed in the calculation of the parent contribution."
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. If we haven’t saved money for college, isn’t community college the only option? 
http://cbshouston.edu	p			While it certainly helps to have saved for your education, there are other ways to pay for college. Families with lower incomes who have not been able to save will likely find that the expectation of them will be quite modest. For families that do not qualify for financial aid, low-interest parent or student loans and tuition payment plans can help.
http://cbshouston.edu	p			* Refund checks are mailed to your home address. For more information contact the Office of Financial Aid @ 832-252-4602.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Q. Federal Pell grant is awarded based on the students number of credit hours by the Department of Education
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Will the number of credits I take and my class attendance have an effect on the amount of PELL I receive?
http://cbshouston.edu	p			Yes. The amount of your Federal Pell Grant is fractionally pro-rated based on your enrollment status each semester. You may determine your enrollment status by counting the number of credits or equated credits for which you have been charged tuition.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			FULL-TIME
http://cbshouston.edu	li			 -- enrolled for 12 or more credits or equated credits equals 100% of a semester's PELL.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			3/4-TIME

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Financial aid is any form of assistance that comes from some organized body that assists a student with the costs of attending college. These forms consist of federal, state, institutional and private funds that are used to assist students in funding their education. Scholarships and grants are “free money “ that you do not pay back, however loans are considered as self-help and you are required to pay them back when a student becomes enrolled less than half-time or graduates. When you seek aid, we will consider you for all forms of aid available.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			After your fees and any other charges on your CBS student account are paid, any remaining financial aid will be refunded to you.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Generally, if the Office of Financial Aid has disbursed aid to your student account and a credit is created, you can expect to receive a refund approximately 30-45 days after Census Date.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Refund checks are mailed to your home address. For more information contact the Financial Aid Office as follows:

http://cbshouston.edu	span			Houston is a vibrant, diverse city, and transfer students enhance the CBS community by bringing a wide variety of life, ministry, and educational experiences to the campus. A transfer student is defined as a student who has previously been enrolled at another accredited college or university.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Transfer Credit
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Transfer Credit will be considered for acceptance on all regular college credit courses taken at an accredited institution. The College reserves the right to accept only those courses where the content, objectives and extent are equivalent to those required for graduation from the College of Biblical Studies. Basic equivalency rules are established by faculty qualification standards set by a department chair and/or Academic Dean and implemented by the Registrar. When a decision/exception is needed, the chair of the particular department and/or Academic Dean should approve.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Please note the following:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students pursuing a Bible Certificate may transfer a maximum of 9-credit hours.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students pursuing an Associate’s degree may transfer a maximum of 18-credit hours.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Students pursuing a Bachelor’s degree may transfer a maximum of 69-credit hours.
http://cbshouston.edu	strong			Eligible transfer credits are governed by the following criteria:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Coursework must be completed at an accredited academic institution, college or university.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Coursework equivalent to courses that are or could be offered at CBS.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Coursework complete with a grade of “C” (2.0) or higher.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Course(s) must be taken for a grade (not taken “pass/fail”).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Coursework completed on a quarter system basis will be converted to semester hours for CBS credit by multiplying quarter hours by 2/3 to calculate semester hours.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Developmental, remedial, continuing education and college orientation courses will not transfer.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Six credit hours may be accepted from non-accredited institutions upon review by the appropriate academic department chair(s) or the Academic Dean.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A transfer credit evaluation will be completed upon receipt of a prospective student’s external transcripts.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Please note that the transfer credit evaluation will remain unofficial until the Transfer Evaluator has approved an official transcript, transfer credit evaluation form and official degree plan. The Office of the Registrar will notify the student by U.S. mail and email regarding all transferrable credits and how they will be applied towards the student’s degree program. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Applicants appealing a transfer credit decision should submit a completed transfer credit appeal form for review by the Director of Admission and Advising, the Vice President for Student and Enrollment Services and the Academic Dean. Applicants may be asked to obtain course descriptions and/or syllabi for courses under appeal.

http://cbshouston.edu	span	em		” – 1 Cor 9:24
http://cbshouston.edu	span			At CBS, we are committed to running our race with diligence and excellence by providing top-rated biblically-based education that transforms and equips our students for greater service to the Houston area, the Church and the world.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Read More about
http://cbshouston.edu	a			What Students Say about CBS
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Our Core: Biblically-based Education
http://cbshouston.edu	em			Education should make us live life with zest, with gusto, with exuberance … and the right kind of education - education that holds to the spiritual conception and that has room for God in it, calls us from apathies that benumb and deaden the soul.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			”  - Lois Lebar
http://cbshouston.edu	em			How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth! I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore, I hate every wrong path. Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			” – Ps 119:103-105
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The  CBS community wants its students to have hearts that are as soft as clay and minds that are sharp as razors. For the Christian, everything that is done is done for the glory of God. He gives everything, including education, meaning and purpose.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Our professors do not work simply to transfer knowledge to our students. Instead, CBS professors encourage the students to “press on” toward excellence because God Himself is excellent, and believers are to imitate Him, both in and out of the classroom (Ps 8:9; Matt 5:48; Eph 6:7).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Our Aim: Preparing Minds for Action
http://cbshouston.edu	em			Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			” – 1 Pet 1:13
http://cbshouston.edu	em			"""Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."
http://cbshouston.edu	span			” – Rom 12:2
http://cbshouston.edu	span		em	CBS remains a place where students can be equipped with God’s truth and then be transformed. A relationship with the Triune God, a commitment to Christ and a sound knowledge of the Scripture lies at the heart of a CBS Christian education. However, we cannot just know the basics of Christianity intellectually, we must also live the Christian life and then 
http://cbshouston.edu	em			live out
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 what we learn. At CBS, our students not only learn the content of Scripture, but they learn what it means to depend upon the Lord, to walk with Him, to hear the still, quiet voice of the Holy Spirit and to be prepared for action.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Our Audience: Those Seeking a Deeper Knowledge of Christ
http://cbshouston.edu	em			And they sang a new song, saying: “You were slain, and with your blood you purchased for God persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			” – Rev 5:9-10
http://cbshouston.edu	span			As the fourth-largest city in the country, Houston serves as a home to people of various races, traditions, ethnicities and languages. The message of the Gospel is a global message, and with our intentional focus on educating minorities, CBS is uniquely positioned as a premier, Christian educational institution to the greater Houston area. With our biblically-based bachelor's and associate's programs, CBS is making a significant impact on the educational attainment of Houston area students.  And with an associate's degree offered completely in the Spanish language, CBS remains committed to having our student body reflect the diversity that is present within the body of Christ.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Our Mission: Christian Service to the Church and the World
http://cbshouston.edu	em		sup	Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves,
http://cbshouston.edu	em			not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			” – Phil 2:1-5
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Believers learn, grow and serve within the context of Christian fellowship. Unity is built as a community of people serves together. At CBS, everyone has a part to play and a contribution to make to the greater community: faculty members give instruction in the Word; staff members provide administrative and spiritual support to the students; alumni return to campus and contribute their time and resources to the school; and finally, the students learn what it means to be salt and light by lovingly spreading the Gospel, not just by what we say but also how we live and serve. The CBS community recognizes that all its members are called to be ambassadors for Christ and serve the greater Houston area, the Church and the world.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Why Choose the College of Biblical Studies

http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about Admissions
http://cbshouston.edu	span			What is an articulation agreement?
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies has chosen to develop partnerships with a few seminaries and universities. One important way of doing this is by forming articulation agreements. An articulation agreement is an officially approved agreement that matches coursework between schools. These are designed to help students make a smooth transition when transferring between the schools. Each school reserves the right to review and determine on an individual basis exactly which courses (if any) transfer and on what basis. Articulation agreements are also helpful when a CBS student decides to attend graduate school. Many schools currently accept an associate’s degree or bachelor’s degree from CBS without formal agreements.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS is proud to be associated by articulation agreement with the following schools.
http://cbshouston.edu	a			Texas A&M Commerce
http://cbshouston.edu	a			Lone Star College System

http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies is a Private Not-for-Profit, 501(c)(3) institution that is recognized by a number of quality assurance agencies for granting degrees. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB), through a Texas Supreme Court ruling regarding a special provision under sections 61.304 and 61.313(a) of the Texas Education Code, has granted CBS the authority to grant degrees under religious exemption because the institution’s degrees are entirely religious in nature.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS is one of only four schools to hold dual-accredited status in the Southeast region. Accredited status is the membership status granted to those colleges that meet their accreditor’s conditions for eligibility and that substantially achieve their respective missions and the criteria for accreditation. It further indicates a demonstrated commitment to ongoing institutional development. CBS believes firmly in the accreditation process to demonstrate excellence (Phil. 4:8-9) in everything it does to prepare students for their God-given calling in life and ministry.

http://cbshouston.edu	span			 about The College of Biblical Studies in the News
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Truth, Training and Transformation
http://cbshouston.edu	span			The College of Biblical Studies–Houston (CBS), formerly Houston Bible Institute (HBI), began as a burden in the heart of the late Rev. Ernest L. Mays, the founder of HBI. He sensed that large segments of the local Christian community were functioning without trained leaders. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			This was especially true within the inner-city minority groups. Out of this concern, Houston Bible & Vocational Institute was incorporated in 1976. Mr. William Thomas, Jr. and Rev. Joe Wall assisted in the development of a multi-racial, interdenominational board, which began working to make the school a reality. Within a short time, a decision was made to focus on biblical and theological training because they felt that there were already adequate resources for vocational training in the area.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			During its 40-plus years of history, CBS has grown in its academic curriculum from offering a few credit and non-credit courses to today’s offerings of a Bible Certificate in English or Spanish language, an Associate of Biblical Studies degree in English and Spanish, and Bachelor of Science degree programs with majors in Biblical Studies, Biblical Counseling, Organizational Leadership and Christian Leadership.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS initially offered classes at the KHCB radio facilities located off the Southwest Freeway at Kirby.  In 1994, a 2-acre campus (18,000 sq. ft. in three buildings) located near Hillcroft and the Southwest Freeway was purchased. Today, CBS serves students online and in three locations – Houston, Indianapolis, and Ft. Wayne.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In the fall of 1979, the first classes of Houston Bible Institute were offered. Rev. Rodney L. Cooper was the school’s first Executive Director. From its inception, the school used the facilities of KHCB-FM, a Houston-based Christian radio network, for its classrooms, and leased administrative space nearby.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In 1983, Rev. Rod Cooper resigned to pursue a Ph.D., and the Board promoted Rev. Jack Arrington, then Vice President, to President. President Arrington continued the difficult task of building the foundation and establishing credibility in the minority community. 
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In 1991, God called Rev. Arrington to the pastorate and Dr. William Boyd to fill his vacancy. Dr. Boyd began the process of building the superstructure on the vision of Mays and the foundation of Cooper and Arrington. He implemented a scholarship program that resulted in significant growth of the College.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Under Dr. Boyd’s leadership, in 1996 the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board certified the school as a college and the name was changed from Houston Bible Institute to College of Biblical Studies–Houston.  In 1999, CBS achieved national accreditation through the Accrediting Association of Bible Colleges (now the Association for Biblical Higher Education).  
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In July 2007, God called Dr. Jay A. Quine to the presidency and Dr. Boyd became the Chancellor. Dr. Quine provided leadership for the creation of the 2008-2013 Strategic Plan that focuses on the addition of a traditional bachelor’s program, a Center for Continuing Studies, and pursuit of regional accreditation.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In June 2012, the College of Biblical Studies-Houston was granted Candidacy status for accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award Certificates and Associate and Baccalaureate degrees.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			In July 2012, God called Dr. William Blocker to the presidency to provide leadership to the College in the pursuit of furthering its impact on families, churches and communities. In 2013, CBS was granted membership into the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACSCOC) and was reaffirmed in its national accreditation with Association of Biblical Higher Education. With Dr. Blocker’s leadership, CBS continues to expand our educational offerings, including:
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Distance Education is launched, enabling students across the nation access to CBS programs.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			Spanish language bachelor’s degree in Christian Leadership is offered.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS becomes a certified training center for the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors (ACBC).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS partners with Dallas Theological Seminary in Houston to offer the 4   1 degree.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			A bachelor’s degree program is created focusing on women’s ministry.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS becomes one of only a few Bible colleges in the nation with dual accreditation through the Association of Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) and the Southern Association of Schools and Colleges Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS’ endowment grows through the sale of 6000 Dale Carnegie property and the purchase of the adjacent 7011 Harwin Drive campus.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS launches the Mays Bible Institute of Life Transformation to minister to the needs of the Christian community.
http://cbshouston.edu	span			CBS acquires Crossroads Bible College in Indianapolis, Indiana to expand our reach and further our mission.

It serves to alert students that they may be eligible for federal income tax education credits. Receipt of Form 1098-T does not indicate eligibility for the tax credit. To determine the amount of qualified tuition and fees paid, and the amount of scholarships and grants received, a taxpayer should use their own financial records. CBS does not provide tax advice and individuals should consult a tax advisor as needed.

http://cbshouston.edu/1098t	span			1098-T Form
http://cbshouston.edu/1098t	span			In January of each year per the IRS guidelines, CBS provides an IRS Form 1098-T to all students who had qualified tuition and other related educational expenses billed to them during the previous calendar year. The form will no longer be mailed because it can be retrieved by logging into the individual student’s account in myrecords.cbshouston.edu and by clicking on 1098-T at the top of their account page.
http://cbshouston.edu/1098t	span			This form is informational only and should not be considered as tax opinion or advice. It serves to alert students that they may be eligible for federal income tax education credits. Receipt of Form 1098-T does not indicate eligibility for the tax credit. To determine the amount of qualified tuition and fees paid, and the amount of scholarships and grants received, a taxpayer should use their own financial records. CBS does not provide tax advice and individuals should consult a tax advisor as needed. 
http://cbshouston.edu/1098t	span			"Please note that all alumni, former students and/or inactive students may log into their myrecords as an ""Alumni"" to access the 1098-T form."
