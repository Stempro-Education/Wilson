http://cooper.edu	p			Founded by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper in 1859, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art offers education in art, architecture and engineering, as well as courses in the humanities and social sciences.
http://cooper.edu	p		a	“My feelings, my desires, my hopes, embrace humanity throughout the world,” Peter Cooper proclaimed in a speech in 1853. He looked forward to a time when, 
http://cooper.edu	a			“knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”
http://cooper.edu	p		a	From its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to 
http://cooper.edu	a			civic virtue and harmony
http://cooper.edu	p		a	Peter Cooper wanted his graduates to acquire the technical mastery and entrepreneurial skills, enrich their intellects and spark their creativity, and develop 
http://cooper.edu	a			a sense of social justice that would translate into action

http://cooper.edu/people	p			Founded by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper in 1859, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art offers education in art, architecture and engineering, as well as courses in the humanities and social sciences.
http://cooper.edu/people	p		a	“My feelings, my desires, my hopes, embrace humanity throughout the world,” Peter Cooper proclaimed in a speech in 1853. He looked forward to a time when, 
http://cooper.edu/people	a			“knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”
http://cooper.edu/people	p		a	From its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to 
http://cooper.edu/people	a			civic virtue and harmony
http://cooper.edu/people	p		a	Peter Cooper wanted his graduates to acquire the technical mastery and entrepreneurial skills, enrich their intellects and spark their creativity, and develop 
http://cooper.edu/people	a			a sense of social justice that would translate into action

http://cooper.edu/people/v	p			Founded by inventor, industrialist and philanthropist Peter Cooper in 1859, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art offers education in art, architecture and engineering, as well as courses in the humanities and social sciences.
http://cooper.edu/people/v	p		a	“My feelings, my desires, my hopes, embrace humanity throughout the world,” Peter Cooper proclaimed in a speech in 1853. He looked forward to a time when, 
http://cooper.edu/people/v	a			“knowledge shall cover the earth as waters cover the great deep.”
http://cooper.edu/people/v	p		a	From its beginnings, Cooper Union was a unique institution, dedicated to founder Peter Cooper's proposition that education is the key not only to personal prosperity but to 
http://cooper.edu/people/v	a			civic virtue and harmony
http://cooper.edu/people/v	p		a	Peter Cooper wanted his graduates to acquire the technical mastery and entrepreneurial skills, enrich their intellects and spark their creativity, and develop 
http://cooper.edu/people/v	a			a sense of social justice that would translate into action
