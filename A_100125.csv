This distinctive program enables you to combine the intimate experience of List College - one of the most renowned Jewish studies colleges in the world - with the secular experience of a liberal arts college for women at Barnard. Students are able to engage in intensive study of Jewish History, Jewish Literature, Jewish thought, Bible, Talmud and Hebrew with leading scholars in these fields. 
http://www.barnard.edu/admissions/jts	strong			Barnard/JTS Double Degree Application Process
