I strive to keep students excited and offer opportunities to experience biology–see something new and wonder what it is, how it works and why it’s there–challenge them, and encourage them to see things from a different perspective, one they may not have considered before, so they can think globally and act locally, especially in the context of environmental sustainability. Really, I teach to give them an opportunity to live our tagline. To be more. Be Loras.

https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p		br	Army Reserve
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p		br	 Officers’ Training Corps
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p			 (ROTC)
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	h3			Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) is the premier college level leadership program, leading to a commission as an Army officer and membership in one of the most respected professions in America.
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p			Students do not require prior military experience or a commitment to the Army for the first two years of the program. During classes, leadership labs, physical training and field training, cadets learn firsthand what it takes to lead others, motivate groups and conduct missions as an officer in the Army. Classes are focused on developing qualities that are necessary for leadership in a military or civilian career: fast and effective decision making, strong vision and goals, confidence and presence, effective communication, and the ability to influence others towards a common goal by providing purpose, motivation and direction.  Students who decide to commit to ROTC have the opportunity to attend various summer training programs both in the U.S. and abroad.  Loras students will take the Military Science classes on the University of Dubuque campus and fall under the University of Northern Iowa host ROTC program.
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p			Students that complete the program and their 4-year degree receive a commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army, serving with the Regular Army (active duty), in the Army Reserve or Army National Guard. They will serve the Army in one of 18 different career fields and begin making a difference in their community and our Nation.
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	header			                 National High School Scholarship Applications            
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p			High School students can compete for one of 2000 full tuition scholarships awarded annually by the Army. The application window opens on June 12 after the junior year and runs through early February of the senior year. The scholarships pay 100% of tuition and fees, $600 per semester for books, and a monthly stipend. Interested students should visit goarmy.com to start the process.  Once students complete the application, they need to do a physical fitness assessment, submit high school transcripts and ACT/SAT score, and complete the process with an interview with a Professor of Military Science.
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	header			                 Campus-based Scholarship program            
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p			Current Loras students can compete for 3-year, 2 ½-year, or 2-year scholarships that pay the same benefits as the high school scholarships. Applicants must be full time students, participate in Military Science classes, meet all qualification criteria, and commit to becoming an Army officer.
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	header			                 ROTC 2-Year Option            
https://www.loras.edu/rotc	p			ROTC Basic Camp is available for college students who did not complete the freshman and sophomore classes or who will be starting a graduate program at UNI.  Basic Camp is a month long training program at Fort Knox, KY and gives credit for the first 4 ROTC classes.  Students who attend Basic Camp can compete for a 2-year scholarship (including graduate programs) that pays 100% of tuition and fees; $600/semester book allowance, and monthly stipend of $420.  Students are not required to make a commitment to the Army until after Basic Camp completion but must meet certain academic, fitness, and other requirements to attend.

Really, I teach to give them an opportunity to live our tagline. To be more. Be Loras.
