https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	span			Five computer scientists will join the faculty of the 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	a	span		Harvard Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	span	a		 (SEAS) this fall, as part of a plan funded by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to increase by 50 percent the size of 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	span	span		Harvard’s computer-science
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	span	span		 faculty.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			The new faculty members are Boaz Barak and Madhu Sudan, both Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science; Scott Kuindersma, assistant professor of engineering and computer science; James Mickens, associate professor of computer science; and Alexander “Sasha” Rush, assistant professor of computer science.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			Adding Barak and Sudan to the faculty builds on a long tradition of excellence in theoretical computer science at Harvard.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p		a	“A defining characteristic of our computer science program is that it is outward-facing,” said 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	a			Francis J. Doyle III
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			, who became the John A. Paulson Dean of SEAS last month. “Our faculty collaborate with colleagues across Harvard — from law, medicine, government, and business to the social sciences and humanities. I am confident that these superb additions to our computer-science faculty will complement our interdisciplinary approach and make important contributions to the field.”
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p		a	“Computer science at Harvard today is small, but excellent,” Ballmer said when he 
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	a			announced
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			 his game-changing gift last year. “It already punches above its weight. With depth in systems, data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, it is focused on high-impact specialties that are literally changing the world.”
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			The rapidly growing SEAS is the newest of the University’s 12 Schools, having transitioned in 2007 from a division to its current status. It was renamed the Harvard Paulson School in June in recognition of a $400 million endowment gift, the largest in Harvard’s history, from John A. Paulson, M.B.A. ’80.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			The number of undergraduate computer-science concentrators has increased by a factor of four since 2007, and the percentage of female students has also grown. Meanwhile, more Harvard students pursuing other disciplines are enrolling in CS courses.
https://harvard.edu/media-relations/seas-adds-to-faculty	p			In the coming years, computer science and other parts of SEAS will expand into new, state-of-the-art facilities on Harvard’s campus in Allston.
