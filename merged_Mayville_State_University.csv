http://mayvillestate.edu	p			        Altru Health System has stepped up to become the signature sponsor of Mayville State University’s Glitz & Glam Gala. The Glitz & Glam Gala is designed to take guests on an entertaining journey for a good cause. This year’s theme is a night in Las Vegas, and entertainment will be provided by Midwest Dueling Pianos.

http://mayvillestate.edu	a			Public invited to attend presentation by meteorologist Daryl Ritchison
http://mayvillestate.edu	p			        Daryl Ritchison, well-known meteorologist and director of the North Dakota Agricultural Weather Network (NDAWN), will make a presentation at Mayville State University Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020. Ritchison’s presentation, “Economic Opportunities in Understanding Weather Patterns,” is being held in conjunction with Mayville State’s annual Business Activity Day and is open to the public.

http://mayvillestate.edu	a			Looking to the future with optimism and confidence
http://mayvillestate.edu	p			        A week ago, we learned that our head football coach, Jeff Larson, has accepted the position of defensive coordinator at Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D. Northern State is his alma mater. He played football for the Wolves. Coach Larson is a native of Aberdeen, and that is where his parents and family members still live. The opportunity to live near family and work at his alma mater was something that he couldn’t pass up.      
http://mayvillestate.edu	a			Larson returning to his alma mater as defensive coordinator, Smith to serve as interim head coach
http://mayvillestate.edu	p			        Jeff Larson has resigned from his position as head football coach at Mayville State University to take the position of defensive coordinator at his alma mater, Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D. Larson earned a bachelor’s degree from Northern State University, where he played linebacker for the Wolves in his hometown of Aberdeen. His last day at Mayville State will be Jan. 10.      
http://mayvillestate.edu	a			Thankful for wonderful opportunities in 2019, we turn the page to an exciting 2020
http://mayvillestate.edu	p			        As 2019 comes to a close, we reflect with grateful hearts on all that has happened and turn the page to what we know will be an exciting 2020. We have been blessed with many opportunities to make an impact as we educate the leaders of tomorrow. We look forward to continuing this important work as we develop new programs and more that will give us additional tools to assist with the workforce needs of our region, state, and country.      
http://mayvillestate.edu	a			Extra-curricular activities such as music enhance the lives of students
http://mayvillestate.edu	p			        I had the good pleasure of attending the Mayville State Music Department’s Madrigal Feast on the evening of Dec. 7. I enjoyed the experience very much. It was a great opportunity to watch our music students shine in an out-of-the-classroom environment.

http://mayvillestate.edu/starfish	strong			What is Starfish?
http://mayvillestate.edu/starfish	p			Starfish is a web-based advising tool that improves the way we support student success at Mayville State University. Students, faculty, and staff can manually raise alerts or flags. Faculty can support and nurture students through kudos for performance improvements and to recognize outstanding contributions. Success is a moving target and students need different kinds of encouragement at different times. Starfish college software will engage students by keeping them informed and prompting them to act when necessary.
http://mayvillestate.edu/starfish	p			Starfish is based on the premise that a campus community engaged with a student will lead to that student's success and that effective campus engagement happens through collaborative efforts between faculty, advisors, and support offices. In addition, individual outreach to students and face-to-face conversations are critical so students know there are people at Mayville State who care about their success.
http://mayvillestate.edu/starfish	p			Starfish college software is intended to promote these important interactions by providing a quick and simple way for faculty to notify advisors and support offices when they have a concern about a student, enabling these support providers to reach out to students in a timely and effective way. More effective support is expected to lead to increased student success, which in turn is ultimately expected to lead to improved retention and graduation rates.
http://mayvillestate.edu/starfish	strong			“Using Starfish has increased student/instructor communication in all of my courses!  Starfish notifications let students know when they are doing well, when they miss a deadline, and how to get support in their classes.

http://www.mayvillestate.edu	a			Looking to the future with optimism and confidence
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	p			        A week ago, we learned that our head football coach, Jeff Larson, has accepted the position of defensive coordinator at Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D. Northern State is his alma mater. He played football for the Wolves. Coach Larson is a native of Aberdeen, and that is where his parents and family members still live. The opportunity to live near family and work at his alma mater was something that he couldn’t pass up.      
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	a			Larson returning to his alma mater as defensive coordinator, Smith to serve as interim head coach
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	p			        Jeff Larson has resigned from his position as head football coach at Mayville State University to take the position of defensive coordinator at his alma mater, Northern State University in Aberdeen, S.D. Larson earned a bachelor’s degree from Northern State University, where he played linebacker for the Wolves in his hometown of Aberdeen. His last day at Mayville State will be Jan. 10.      
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	a			Thankful for wonderful opportunities in 2019, we turn the page to an exciting 2020
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	p			        As 2019 comes to a close, we reflect with grateful hearts on all that has happened and turn the page to what we know will be an exciting 2020. We have been blessed with many opportunities to make an impact as we educate the leaders of tomorrow. We look forward to continuing this important work as we develop new programs and more that will give us additional tools to assist with the workforce needs of our region, state, and country.      
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	a			Extra-curricular activities such as music enhance the lives of students
http://www.mayvillestate.edu	p			        I had the good pleasure of attending the Mayville State Music Department’s Madrigal Feast on the evening of Dec. 7. I enjoyed the experience very much. It was a great opportunity to watch our music students shine in an out-of-the-classroom environment.
