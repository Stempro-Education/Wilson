https://mlc-wels.edu	p			“I was really impressed with the 10 young adults from MLC who helped with hurricane cleanup in Panama City. They represented their Savior and their school very well. All of them were self-starters, and every one worked hard . . . not a slacker in the bunch. They were polite and attentive. These future teachers and pastors give me great hope for the future!”

http://www.mlc-wels.edu	p			“I was really impressed with the 10 young adults from MLC who helped with hurricane cleanup in Panama City. They represented their Savior and their school very well.
