https://www.uwec.edu	a			Inspiring dreams
https://www.uwec.edu	p			Biology student Muriel knew she wanted a career in medicine. And when Dr. Phillips asked her to join his team she discovered a new passion — research. But it wasn't medicine or research that brought her here — it was her passion for music.

https://www.uwec.edu	a			Changing perspectives
https://www.uwec.edu	p			Liberal studies student Jalen’s perspective changed when he examined the higher education experiences of black students at predominantly white institutions in the U.K. and learned that men in the U.K. do not feel as marginalized as those in the U.S.
https://www.uwec.edu	a			Facing stigmas
https://www.uwec.edu	p			When graphic communications student Kyler realized his mental health was suffering, he put college on hold. With support from his family and UWEC, Kyler faced his issues head-on and less than a year later found himself back on campus and thriving.

Pushing its students towards new experiences, exposing us to the problems of the world, and preparing us with critical thinking skills so we can be part of the world’s solution, not the problem.

http://www.uwec.edu	p			At the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, we redefine the college experience to prepare you for success.

http://www.uwec.edu	a			Inspiring dreams
http://www.uwec.edu	p			Biology student Muriel knew she wanted a career in medicine. And when Dr. Phillips asked her to join his team she discovered a new passion — research. But it wasn't medicine or research that brought her here — it was her passion for music.

http://www.uwec.edu	a			Changing perspectives
http://www.uwec.edu	p			Liberal studies student Jalen’s perspective changed when he examined the higher education experiences of black students at predominantly white institutions in the U.K. and learned that men in the U.K. do not feel as marginalized as those in the U.S.
http://www.uwec.edu	a			Facing stigmas
http://www.uwec.edu	p			When graphic communications student Kyler realized his mental health was suffering, he put college on hold. With support from his family and UWEC, Kyler faced his issues head-on and less than a year later found himself back on campus and thriving.
http://www.uwec.edu	p			UW-Eau Claire is a university living up to its full potential by offering opportunities for its students to produce excellence. Pushing its students towards new experiences, exposing us to the problems of the world, and preparing us with critical thinking skills so we can be part of the world’s solution, not the problem.
