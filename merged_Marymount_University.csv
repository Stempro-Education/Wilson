http://www.marymount.edu/Athletics	span			October 10, 2017
http://www.marymount.edu/Athletics	span			For the sixth year, the Marymount men's lacrosse team has teamed up with the Mason Leach Superstar Fund to help organize and run the Mason Mile.     The Mason Leach Superstar Fun was created in memory of Mason Leach, a young boy who was taken far too early due to a form of medulloblastomas, the most common malignant brain tumor for children between the ages of 4 and 10 years.     The fighter, high-spirited and easy-to-love Mason passed away on October 13, 2007, but his spirit and story will forever live on.     The Mason Leach Superstar Fund works to encourage and empower patients at American Childhood Cancer Organization to recognize their inner strength and feel like superstars.     The men's lacrosse team has teamed up again to run the Mason Mile, this year hosted at the Marymount University Ballston Center in the heart of Arlington, Virginia on Saturday, October 21.

http://www.marymount.edu/Athletics	span			Senior Brooke Saunders and the Marymount cross country team are taking the Ireton Lawn on Wednesday afternoon from 12:30 PM to 3 PM to sell donuts.     Why donuts? Because donuts are Victoria Marsh's favorite food of course! Victoria is a great friend of Brooke from home in Delaware. Victoria was born with Down Syndrome, and a few years ago, developed Osteosarcoma, a bone cancer.     Osteosarcoma is a cancer that has no cure, and Victoria will be battling this cancer for the rest of her life. But, you can help! By heading to the Ireton Lawn on Wednesday afternoon to buy some donuts, all the proceeds will go to MIB Agents, a non-profit organization for osteosarcoma.     Come out and support a great cause!     If you cannot make it to campus to purchase any donuts, feel free to go to www.mibagents.org to donate to the cause.
