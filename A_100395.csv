http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	h5			THE TYPE OF STUDENT WHO MAKES A RAM
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			Every incoming class looks different, though every class reflects our commitment to maintaining high academic standards and providing access to higher education as part of our land-grant mission.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	h4			Freshman class profile
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			This data reflects the middle 50% of freshmen admitted for Fall 2019. This means 75% of the students we admitted presented credentials at or above the ranges displayed here, and the other 25% were admitted with credentials slightly below these ranges. While this should give you an idea of where the center of a class lies, it does not reflect minimum requirements to be admitted.

http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			Our review process allows us to learn about your academic successes and the experiences that have impacted and prepared you for life at Colorado State. These are the four areas we concentrate on when considering your application.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	strong			RIGOR
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	 We verify that you’ll complete our 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	a			18 recommended units
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			 and consider the range and relative difficulty of the courses you’ve taken each year.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	strong			INVOLVEMENT
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			 Your meaningful engagement in school, extra-curricular and community activities can help us understand your strengths and interests.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	strong			PERFORMANCE
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			 We’ll evaluate your GPA and trends in grades over time and in each subject and assess your test scores.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	strong			ADDITIONAL FACTORS
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			 We seek to understand circumstances that have impacted your course selection, performance, and involvement.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	Some 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	a			competitive majors
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			 require specific course work, a higher grade point average, and/or a higher test score for direct admission to the major.

http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	h5			THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	h4			You’re in control
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			Completing the online application typically takes 30-45 minutes, not including the time you spend crafting your personal statement.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	Within 1-2 days after you submit your application, you’ll receive an email with instructions to create your eID to 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	a			check your application status online
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			. Check your status regularly for nearly real-time information, including the decision on your application.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			We’ll use email to keep you updated, too. Check your email at least once a week throughout the admission process. PRO TIP: Use an email address other than a school address.

http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	h4			How decisions work
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			Complete application files are reviewed on a rolling basis, and most decisions are made within 2-3 weeks.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			Check your email and online status regularly; decisions are announced electronically before anything is mailed. The official admit packet usually arrives by mail 2-3 weeks after admission.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			Notifications generally fall into one of these four categories:
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		br	FULLY ADMITTED
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	 Most admitted students qualify for their first choice major. Then it’s time to move on to the 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	a			next steps for admitted students
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		br	FULLY ADMITTED: ALTERNATE MAJOR
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	 Some students are admitted to their alternate major or to an undeclared advising track because they don’t qualify for direct admission to a 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	a			competitive major
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	. These students move on to the 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		br	MORE INFORMATION REQUIRED
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p			 Some applicants must submit more information, such as a new transcript or test scores, evidence of English proficiency, or an explanation of circumstances.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		br	NOT ADMITTED
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	 Students not offered admission are encouraged to

http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	h4			After a decision has been made
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/freshmen	p		a	Admitted students receive additional communications from Admissions and other CSU offices outlining the confirmation and enrollment processes. To stay on track to enroll, admitted students are expected to check email regularly and to complete the

http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li			Failure to disclose all institutions attended, regardless of whether credits were earned or will be transferable, is grounds for rejection or dismissal.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Undergraduate students are required to complete at least three credits of mathematics as part of a CSU degree. The admission requirement in mathematics is designed to ensure that transfer applicants are on track to satisfy this graduation requirement.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			There are several ways to satisfy the mathematics requirement, including taking the Mathematics Placement Exam. Learn how at the link below.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			Mathematics Requirement Information
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h5			ACT and SAT
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li			ACT and SAT results are not evaluated in the admission decision but can be helpful for composition and math placement purposes if you have not taken transferable college composition or mathematics courses.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li		a	CSU’s 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			ACT
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li		a	 code is 0504. Our 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			SAT/College Board
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li			 code is 4075. Allow 2-3 weeks for scores to arrive at CSU from the testing agencies.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h5			AP, IB and CLEP
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li		a	AP, IB and CLEP results can be considered for 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			transfer credit
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	li			 after you’ve been admitted and once official score results have been sent to CSU; these results will not be considered in the admission decision.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	You will have the opportunity to complete an optional “
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			Academic Explanation
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			” section within the application to address circumstances that have impacted your academic record.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			You are strongly encouraged to write an Academic Explanation if you have a cumulative GPA below 2.5, D/F grades within the past year, and/or erratic trends or a pattern of withdrawals in your prior college work.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	Submitting your documents, transcripts and fee is easy and we’re always here to help. Start by reviewing 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			submission instructions
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 and contact us if you have any questions.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h1			Who we look for
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h5			THE TYPE OF STUDENT THAT MAKES A RAM
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Every incoming class looks different, but we always work to maintain high academic standards while providing access to higher education as part of our land-grant mission.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h4			Transfer class profile
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			This data reflects the middle 50% of transfers admitted for Fall 2019. That means 75% of the students we admitted had credentials at or above the ranges displayed here, and 25% had credentials slightly below these ranges. While this should give you an idea of where the center of a class lies, it does not reflect specific minimums for admission consideration.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h5			MIDDLE 50% GPA
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h5			MIDDLE 50% TRANSFER CREDITS
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h4			Important Factors
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			A 2.0 cumulative GPA for all college work attempted is the threshold for consideration. Applicants who have a cumulative GPA below 2.5 should be prepared to demonstrate academic success in the form of an upward GPA trend and no D/F grades in their most recent terms.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Students transferring more than 90 credits may not be able to complete their major in a timely manner, and credits that transfer may not meet specific degree requirements at CSU.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h4			Our review process
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Our review process allows us to learn about your academic successes and the experiences that have impacted and prepared you for life at Colorado State. These are the four areas we concentrate on when considering your application.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	RIGOR
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 We recommend you take college-level courses in a range of subjects. Be sure to include a mathematics course; composition also is recommended but not required.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	INVOLVEMENT
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 We review each application holistically and can consider your involvement in school and community activities in our decision.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	PERFORMANCE
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 Performance can be as important as rigor. We consider not only your cumulative GPA but also your trends in grades over time and across subjects.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	ADDITIONAL FACTORS
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 We will consider circumstances that have impacted your course selection and performance. Use the Academic Explanation section of the application to provide this context.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	Some 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			competitive majors
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 require specific course work and a higher grade point average in order to be admitted.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h1			What to expect
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h5			THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	strong			Completing your application
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			The time it takes to submit a complete application is unique to each student depending on the amount of time it takes to receive supporting documents. The application form typically takes 30-45 minutes.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	Within three days after you’ve submitted your application, you’ll receive an email with your CSU ID and 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			instructions to log in to RAMweb
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 to check your application status online.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Allow 3-5 business days for documents you’ve submitted electronically to be reflected as received and matched to your application (documents sent by mail can take slightly longer).
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	h3			Already have your eID?
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Log in to RAMweb to check your application status.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			Log in to RAMweb
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	strong			Once your application is complete
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Complete applications are reviewed on a rolling basis in the order they are received, and most decisions are made within 2-4 weeks. Continue to check your email and RAMweb regularly for updates; decisions are announced electronically before anything is sent through the mail. The official admit packet typically arrives by mail within 2-3 weeks after admission.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			Notifications generally fall into one of these four categories:
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	FULLY ADMITTED
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	 Most students admitted to CSU enter their first choice major. Then it’s time to move on to the 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			next steps for admitted students
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	FULLY ADMITTED: ALTERNATE MAJOR
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	 Some students are admitted to their alternate major or to an undeclared advising track because they don’t qualify for direct admission to a 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			competitive major
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	. These students move on to the 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	MORE INFORMATION REQUIRED
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 Some applicants are prompted to submit more information, such as an updated transcript, math placement results, evidence of English proficiency or an explanation of circumstances.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		br	NOT ADMITTED
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	 Students who are not offered admission are encouraged to complete additional college-level work elsewhere before applying again. Students can 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			request reconsideration
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	 of their current application with new academic information. Contact your 
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	a			admissions counselor
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p			 for guidance.
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	strong			After a decision has been made
http://admissions.colostate.edu/apply/transfer	p		a	Admitted students receive additional communications from Admissions and other CSU offices outlining the confirmation and enrollment processes. To stay on track to enroll, admitted students are expected to check email regularly and make sure to complete the
