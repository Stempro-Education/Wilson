http://aoma.edu	h3			Message from Dr. Mary Faria, President and Chief Executive Officer of AOMA
http://aoma.edu	p			AOMA has been one of the most respected Schools of Integrative Medicine in the country for over 25 years. It is also one of the most respected providers of acupuncture and Chinese Medicine in Austin - AOMA serves about 18,000 patient visits annually. The strength of the AOMA experience for students and patients comes from our dedicated Board of Governors, our gifted and dedicated operations and academic team, our outstanding faculty, and the amazing individuals who are our students. Our Mission is to transform lives and communities and that begins with the transformation of those who come to us to learn and grow both professionally and spiritually. It is also demonstrated in the impressive work and accomplishments of our alumni and in our clinical outcomes for our patients.
http://aoma.edu	p			My hope is that when you connect with us as a student or patient you experience our Mission in that you are transformed in some way. We continue to develop strong partnerships in our community that will allow us to better serve. These partnerships are opening doors for stronger collaborative and integrative opportunities to make a difference with issues like the opioid crisis, other types of addiction, and chronic health issues, addressed through integrative models of care and through collaborative research. It is indeed an exciting time for Traditional Chinese Medicine.  The  cover of the January 2019 edition of  National Geographic Magazine stated it well, “The future of Medicine – How new technologies and ancient remedies are transforming health care.”   AOMA is a leader in this transformation!
