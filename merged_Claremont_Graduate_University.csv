https://www.cgu.edu/give	p		br	You may be able to double or even triple the impact of your gift. Check with your Human Resources department to see if your company will match your contributions. Please indicate on your pledge if your company offers such a program.
https://www.cgu.edu/give	a			Ways to Give to CGU
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			When you make a gift to Claremont Graduate University, you have flexibility in determining how the funds will be used as well as options for how to make your gift.
https://www.cgu.edu/give	strong			Unrestricted Gifts
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			 Unrestricted gifts are among the most valuable to CGU; they allow the university to allocate funds wherever the need is greatest and to take advantage of unique opportunities as they arise. Your unrestricted contribution may be used to offset costs associated with financial aid, make innovations in teaching, provide research equipment, enhance facilities, and much more.
https://www.cgu.edu/give	strong			Directed Gifts
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			 Directed gifts allow you to designate your gift to a specific school, program, or any priority area at the university. When you make a directed gift to CGU, you enjoy the satisfaction of knowing you are supporting a program that is personally meaningful to you.

https://www.cgu.edu/give	strong			Matching Gifts
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			 Annual Fund gifts are a great way for alumni and friends of CGU to pledge support on an annual basis. Moreover, if your company has a matching-gift program, you can double or even triple your Annual Fund donation. These programs typically match all or a percentage of employee contributions to charitable organizations, making the employer a partner in its employees’ personal philanthropy. Simply obtain a matching-gift form from your employer’s personnel office, fill it out, and provide it to CGU with your contribution.
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			Use our search tool to see if your employer has a matching gift policy.

https://www.cgu.edu/give	a			Types of Gifts
https://www.cgu.edu/give	strong			Cash gifts
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			 are simple. They can be made with credit or debit card transactions, or by cash, personal checks, cashier’s checks, or money orders made payable to Claremont Graduate University.
https://www.cgu.edu/give	a			Make a Cash Gift
https://www.cgu.edu/give	strong			Gifts of appreciated securities, stocks, and bonds
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			 provide considerable tax advantages when transferred to CGU before they are sold. If you have held your securities for more than one year, you may find that your gift will provide a twofold tax benefit, creating an income-tax deduction as well as helping avoid the capital gains tax that would have been due on their sale.
https://www.cgu.edu/give	a			Make a Stock Transfer
https://www.cgu.edu/give	strong			Gifts of real estate
https://www.cgu.edu/give	p			—including personal residences, second homes, income property, and vacant land—offer a wide variety of tax and other benefits. Whereas most people give their entire interest away, it is also possible to give only a portion of the property while retaining the rest for other purposes.
