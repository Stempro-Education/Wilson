https://calendar.utk.edu/student_union_2019	p		br	One of my very first experiences with events outside of the classroom for the University of Tennessee and my college life in general and I can say it was absolutely phenomenal. I originally went into it with the mind that it would just be an incredibly interesting subject for me to hear, and then came out with not only a new perspective on race relations as it correlates to higher education, but also a lot more useful information on how research is conducted in the field I wish to go into.  I also gained a better insight in how to phrase the questions I wish to ask in a more professional way. The speaker was also very charismatic and used humor as an effective way to diffuse the normal tensions that come with heavy subjects like race relations within the United States. Though judging by the people around me a lot of students were simply there because they had to be for whatever program or class  they were in which did kill the atmosphere a bit for me. The reasons in which it did so were because I experienced people using their phones without headphones,  rude hecklers that yelled at the people brave enough to come forward with questions, and just the sad look of some people clearly not wanting to be there.  
https://calendar.utk.edu/student_union_2019	p			Tldr; Great talk, Wonderful engaging speaker, Came out with knowledge that will help in my classes, A minority of people were rude there

Great organizations are built on trust, vision, shared understanding and prudent risk, all of which contribute to great command climate...or in our case, the Volunteer Spirit.
