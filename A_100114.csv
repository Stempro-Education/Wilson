http://www.baker.edu/admissions	span			As a not-for-profit college, we concentrate on creating the best experience possible for our students. Our innovative classrooms and labs are equipped with the latest tools and technologies professionals use on the job. Being a non-profit means we’re also able to make a quality education affordable by offering a lower tuition.
