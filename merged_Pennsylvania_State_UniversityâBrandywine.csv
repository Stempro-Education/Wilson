http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			PURPOSE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			The purpose of this policy is to define the responsibilities and limitations of the University in responding to requests for use of facilities not related to an educational program of the University. The intent of the policy is to ensure optimum use of resources and develop and maintain good public relations with organized groups wishing to use these resources. This policy does not apply to The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, or the Bryce Jordan Center.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	Accommodations in residence halls are available only for students and Continuing Education participants and, as required, for participants in University-sponsored programs. (See 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			Policy AD03
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			.) Any exceptions to this statement must be approved by the Associate Vice President for Auxiliary and Business Services. Specific facilities may be subject to additional policies.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			GENERAL
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Use of University facilities by non-University groups such as organized civic, cultural, service, religious, and industrial organizations, public school groups, and college and university groups with memberships not restricted to Penn State students, faculty, and staff may be approved subject to the guidelines established by this policy and other appropriate University regulations.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			This policy does not apply to registered student organizations at any location of the University.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			PRIORITY
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			University use of all facilities shall have absolute preemptive priority over all non-University groups. The University reserves the right to cancel, postpone, or alter arrangements for any event if necessary.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			AIMS AND PURPOSES
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			The use of facilities must be for purposes which do not conflict with the general aims and purposes of University regulations or local, state and federal laws. Approval to use facilities does not necessarily imply approval of the aims and purposes of the sponsoring organization nor the event being planned.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	The use of the facility must be for noncommercial purposes. (See 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			Policy AD27
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			FUND RAISING
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Except as set forth below, the use of facilities shall not have as its purpose the raising of funds for activities or causes unrelated to the University.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			If any fund raising activity takes place, a detailed plan for the designation of funds must be specifically approved by the appropriate budget executive at the respective University location. No funds can be distributed to any organization or individual other than a tax-exempt organization.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	h4			At the University Park campus:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	li		br	The use of facilities for fund raising shall be limited to those facilities which have approved rental rates (e.g., golf courses, indoor tennis courts, ice skating rink, etc.).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	li		br	Other recreational facilities intended for academic instruction, intramural or intercollegiate athletic programs, or individual recreational programs, will not be used for fund raising purposes.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	li			Fund raising activities must be conducted in conjunction with, or co-sponsored by, an organized student group, University college, department or administrative unit. Co-sponsorship must be by a bona fide parallel-interest organization with equal participation in the planning and implementation of the activity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	h4	ol		At Non-University Park Locations:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	li			Approved use of facilities by non-University groups for the purposes of fund raising may or may not be restricted to co-sponsorship by an authorized University group.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			USE OF THE UNIVERSITY NAME
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	Any use of the name of the University, other than to indicate the location of the event, must be approved in advance by the University through the Office of the Senior Vice President for Finance and Business/Treasurer (per 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			Policy AD07
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			PROVISION OF FOOD
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	The provision of food and beverages by other than the authorized University agent operating or contracting for food and beverage services is specifically prohibited. (Refer to 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			Policy AD26
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			POSTING OF MATERIAL
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Individuals and groups may post commercial and noncommercial announcements on the University's general purpose bulletin boards. As appropriate, related noncommercial announcements may be posted on specific purpose bulletin boards. (General purpose boards and specific purpose boards will be specifically labeled.)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Except as permitted herein, no poster, handbill, or any form of announcement or statement can be placed on, attached to, or written on any structure or natural feature of the campus such as doors, buildings, windows, the surface of walkways, roads, fountains, posts, waste receptacles, trees or stakes, or posted on motor vehicles.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Information must be provided in advance to the University concerning any financial activities or transactions planned by the non-University group during its use of the facility.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			PAYMENT OR EXPENSES INCURRED
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	The group will reimburse the University for identifiable increments to the University's operating or overhead expenses imposed by the use of the facility. In addition, the University may charge a fee for the use of its facilities provided that all provisions of 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			Policy AD15
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			 are met.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			PHYSICAL SAFETY AND GENERAL WELFARE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	The group using the facilities must agree to take precautions to assure the physical safety of participants and University property, and to release the University from any liability in conjunction with the use of the facility. A 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			University Release and Indemnification Agreement
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	 must be used for this purpose. (See the applicable 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			instructions
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			 in GURU.) University Release and Indemnification Agreement forms are available in the Department of Community Relations, Office of Strategic Communications at University Park. At all other locations, they are available in the office of the campus executive officer or dean/provost.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			A copy of the completed University Release and Indemnification Agreement must be forwarded to the Risk Management Office at University Park.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	The University reserves the right to require insurance coverage and may require the presence of University Safety personnel for any group requesting to use University facilities. (See Administrative Guideline 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			ADG04
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	a			PROCEDURE FOR REQUESTING APPROVAL
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p		a	Non-University groups wishing to use the University Park facilities (except The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, and the Bryce Jordan Center) within the above policy (or policies

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			NOTE: Prior to approval of requests for use of facilities at University Park, Strategic Communications shall check with The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, and the Bryce Jordan Center, to assure that approval for the use of specific facilities requested will not interfere with plans in progress by these entities for the use of those facilities. When approvals are granted, copies of such approvals shall be provided to The Nittany Lion Inn, The Penn Stater Conference Center and Hotel, or the Bryce Jordan Center, as appropriate.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Non-University groups wishing to use facilities at locations other than University Park within the above policy shall apply to the budget executive at the campus or facility. These applications are acted upon by the budget executive who is responsible for ascertaining the appropriateness of the request within the policy set forth above and for making the final decision concerning the request.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad02	p			Strategic Communications (at University Park), and the budget executive (at locations other than University Park), shall keep complete records of the authorized use of facilities by non-University groups.

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			Further Information
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h3	ul		PURPOSE:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			To state the University's policy with respect to the approval and application of fees and rates for use of, or patronage of, certain University facilities and services. This includes fees and rates charged to other University departments (internal rates), as well as to external customers.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			This policy does not apply to the following:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		a	Student tuition or fees charged to the student account (assessed to students at the University, college, department or major level)  see Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			BT06
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		a	Fund-raising or development events conducted by the University  see Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			FN10
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Donor levels approved through Development which grant access to programs or certain levels of benefits.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Continuing Education non-credit course fees  this authority is delegated to the Directors of Continuing Education at each campus location.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Long-term lease/rental fees  these must be approved through the Property Steering Committee (Senior VP for Finance & Business).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Intercollegiate Athletic (ICA) Varsity Athletic events.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		a	Center or Industry membership programs – see 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			RAG05
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			 - Establishing Research Institutes, Consortia, and Centers (Formerly RAG18).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h3	ul		SCOPE:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Thus, fees and rates coming under the scope of this policy would include (but not be limited to) such activities as:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			The use of sports facilities - including golf courses, tennis facilities, natatorium, ice pavilion, etc.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			All non-ICA athletic events for which admission is charged, regardless of where the fee income flows [fee still must be approved even if admission price goes to Associated Student Activities (ASA), the Student Government Association (SGA) or the Graduate Student Association (GSA)].
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			All cultural and entertainment events for which admission is charged, except those sponsored by ASA, the SGA and the GSA.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Use of buildings, auditoriums, conference facilities, special rooms, etc, including related equipment.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		br	Special fees, such as penalty fees for returned checks, vehicle registrations, traffic violations penalties, etc.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			   ​Please note that certain fees are controlled by Central Offices (i.e. the returned check fee) and should be consistently applied across the University.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Space rates charged for placing advertisements in University publications, including student newspapers if subsidized by the University.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Student fees for specific courses related to field trips, supplies or knowledge materials (textbooks, CD-ROMs, course packets), unless the charge to students is based strictly on cost recovery (students charged exact amount incurred by department).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Services provided by Auxiliary and Business Services units with the exception of menu prices and hotel rates for Housing & Food Services and Penn State Hospitality Services and concessions for Bryce Jordan Center and Intercollegiate Athletics.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Services provided to other departments such as copy or printing services, if the unit providing the services is operating as a full-cost recovery operation. This would also include any such services offered to external customers, even if on an irregular basis.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Rates established by recharge or service centers, such as lab or research equipment facilities, where all users are direct charged for the use of the services offered. These centers may operate as either general fund operations, or University Services/Auxiliary Enterprises.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h3	ol		GENERAL PROVISIONS:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Funds derived from the charging of fees or rates must be accounted for as income(as opposed to credit to expense) and must be credited to the account to which the related expenses are charged.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Fees or rates may not be established solely for the purpose of generating discretionary departmental income, especially if the department is funded to provide the activity or service at no or reduced cost. Fees or rates should be established only for units established as income generating by nature, or in other situations considered appropriate by the Financial Officer.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			Policy FN14
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			 prohibits services to an outside audience (non-University related or commercial), unless the service is commercially unavailable within the region of a campus and has the prior written approval of the Corporate Controller. In such a case the unit must provide clear rationale why the University should be providing this service to the commercial sector. In general, services being provided which are also provided commercially must be fully-costed, including the application of fringe and overhead. Auxiliary Enterprise units are exempt from this prohibition for purposes of this policy. Units operating as University Services or through general funds can obtain permission through the fee and rate submission process by identifying rates to be charged to non-University-related or commercial enterprises. In those cases, comparable market data for rates charged by others may be required.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Certain cost-recovery fees, such as for centralized copy or fax services for a campus or department or charges to external not-for-profit groups for direct costs of providing security, do not require approval under this policy if the same rate fee is charged consistently to all units and the unit recovering the costs is not a full-cost recovery operation. The recovery of these charges fees should be accounted for as credit to expense rather than income.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			In cases where these cost-recovery fees will be applied to contracts or grants, prior approval of the rate is NOT required provided that the cost is charged based on actual costs incurred. However, the following must be considered:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		a	Costs that would normally be considered an indirect cost, such as copying, printing, telephone, courier services, and mailing costs – would not be permitted to be charged as direct costs on a sponsored award unless the award is considered a major program or a cost justification form has been approved. See 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			Cost Accounting FAQs
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			 for more detail.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			For recharge centers that are recovering full costs, these costs can be billed at the actual cost rate, but it must be noted in all rate submissions that these costs will be billed based on actual costs as invoiced from vendor.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p	ul		The department/unit will be responsible for retaining and providing invoices, etc and user logs to substantiate the rates applied to contracts or grants upon request from authorized University personnel or external auditors.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h3			APPROVAL OF FEES AND RATES:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			There are two types of fees/rates that require approval:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Fees for University services, activities, facilities or events. Fees are often not cost-based and may not necessarily have any associated costs, such as library fines. Fees may also be based on market pricing. Fees which are not developed on a full cost basis are not approved for use with governmental entities, especially as charges to federally sponsored grants and contracts.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Recharge rates, which must be approved for all University-related services that charge federal grants and contracts. These rates must be approved to assure that the cost basis used to develop the fee rate is appropriate and that the federal government will be not overcharged for the services provided. If income exceeds expenses in any one year, the fee must be adjusted the following year to allow the federal government to recover the excess (i.e. cost basis must be lowered).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p	ol		Both new fees/rates and revisions to established fees/rates must be approved by the Corporate Controllers Office, except as noted below.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h4			Limited Delegation of Approval Authority:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Financial Officers have the authority to approve fees and rates in the following situations:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Admission fees for cultural and entertainment events (such as theatrical productions) if the fee will be $50 or less (excludes SGA and ASA events).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Fees for student field trips based strictly on recovery of direct costs, such as reimbursement for transportation costs or admission fees.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Pass-through fees, for items such as insurance or supplies, where the costs are passed directly to the customer based on the exact price paid to the supplier.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			Recharge center rates changes of 10% or less in rates (on average based on the requested rate) can be approved by the Financial Officer; however, if the rate analysis is complex or complicated, such as a change in methodology used to calculate the rate, the Financial Officer has the discretion to refer the fee approval to Cost Analysis.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p	ol		Copies of fee or rate approvals granted by the Financial Officers must be sent to the Corporate Controller's Office (or Controller's Office for the College of Medicine).
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Contracts for artistic or other events that set the admission fee as a condition of the contract do not require a separate submission of a request for fee approval. Approval of the contract by the Controller's Office will also be approval of the fees established in the contract.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h4			Approval Process:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p		a	The unit requesting approval must complete the form 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			Submission of Proposal for New or Existing Fees
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			, and prepare all supporting documentation as listed. If the fee or rate may be charged to federal or federal flow-through sponsored awards or directly to governmental entities as external customers, then the form must indicate that the fee or rate will apply to the federal government, and a full-costing model will need to be used to develop the fee or rate.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Recharge rates and rates charged to sponsored programs will require more detail than fees, especially in providing detail as to the cost basis used to calculate the fee. Those submitting rates must provide adequate documentation to meet the audit standards of the federal government. The Financial Officer and Cost Analysis may request more detail to document or justify a cost change or element based on auditor expectations, requirements or guidelines.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			All fees and rates must be submitted in an Excel spreadsheet, which will be returned to the unit that submitted the fees or rates as an official read-only copy and as a modifiable working copy.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			The request for fee/rate approval must be approved by the Budget Executive and the Financial Officer. Upon review and approval, unless the Financial Officer has limited authority to approve as previously noted, the Financial Officer will forward the request for fee/rate approval to the Corporate Controllers Office for approval as follows:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		ul	All recharge rates which include direct and indirect costs being charged to federal grants and contracts, must be initially reviewed and approved by Cost Analysis, with final approval by the Corporate Controller's Office. College of Medicine rates should be sent to the Associate Controller for the College of Medicine. Revisions to current rates may be approved by the Financial Officer if under 10% (on average), otherwise these must also be submitted to Cost Analysis. These rates will remain in effect until new rates are approved; however certain specialized service rates (see note below) require biennial approval, even if the rates do not change. The Cost Analysis office can provide assistance in developing such rates. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		a	Specialized Service Centers are specially designated recharge centers. These are defined by federal policy, 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			2 CFR part 220, ''Cost Principles for Educational Institutions (OMB Circular A–21)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			 Appendix A, Section J.47 and based on these definitions, the University has designated certain recharge centers as Specialized Service Centers, including all Animal Facilities and the Materials Characterization Lab.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li		ul	Rates can remain the same year after year. However, all recharge centers must perform an ANNUAL review to determine if the rates in place are resulting in under or over recovery of costs. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			If upon conducting the annual review, a recharge center determines that the current rates resulted in over recovery of costs, then the rates need to be adjusted to reflect not only current costing structure but also adjustments to resolve the over recovery. The center would follow the process described above to submit new rates.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			If a recharge center determines that the current rates are under recovering – which means that the rates are being subsidized – the center can either adjust rates to more fully recover cost (and submit for approval as detailed above), or can maintain the same rates. However, any funds used to provide the subsidy must be identified to Cost Analysis so these funds can be eliminated from the cost pools used to calculate the F&A rate.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p	ul		The unit is responsible for reviewing rates, and if no fee adjustments are required, providing a statement certifying to the Financial Officer that the rates in place are appropriate with a copy provided to Cost Analysis. The unit is responsible for maintaining records of the annual review.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			All other fees (not recharge rates) must be reviewed and approved by Cost Analysis, with final approval by the Corporate Controller's Office (except for the College of Medicine which is reviewed and approved by the Associate Controller of the College of Medicine). These fees will be approved for an indefinite time but must be resubmitted if the fees change (increase or decrease) or if the costs underlying the fee structure change substantially.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p	ul		Units should plan in advance for obtaining fee/rate approvals.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			While specific timelines cannot be set based on workload changes throughout the year, units should allow for more time for approval of new or complex fees or rates.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Units may request that fees or rates be established for use both at University Park and campus locations, including providing a range of fees (fee will range from $5 to $10). If the fee or rate is approved for all locations, a campus does not need to separately request approval for the fee. However, if a campus determines that it wishes to charge a fee or rate different than the one approved, it must be submitted for approval.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			When fees/rates are approved by the Corporate Controllers Office, the Financial Officer will receive the approval notice and should maintain files for all currently approved fees and rates, as well as a history file for previous fees. The history file must be retained for seven years. Units submitting rates must retain records to support the approved rates and the costs used to develop those rates. Cost Analysis will maintain a record of all officially approved rates.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	h3			COLLECTION OF FEES AND RATES:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			All fees and rates approved through this policy must be consistently applied to all entities receiving the goods or service. The unit may not waive, reduce or increase established and approved fees or rates for any reason, unless a list of approved waivers and those authorized to exercise these waivers are included as part of the fee/rate approval request. The Corporate Controller's Office may also grant waivers or exceptions to charging established fees or rates on a case-by-case(non-continuing) basis, with adequate documentation of the situation requiring the adjustment or waiver.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p			Income collected through the fees or rates must be properly reported and accounted for in the authorized University account. The income must be credited to the same account to which the expenses of the operation are charged. Fees or rates collected for services provided through a general fund operation must be accounted for in a general fund account. Financial Officers should be consulted on how to properly account for income generated by fees or rates. In some cases, it may be appropriate for fees or rates to be managed as credit to expense; but these need to be approved through the Financial Officer. Refer to the following Policies for information regarding the reporting and accounting of fees:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			FN01
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			 - Processing Cash Revenues
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	a			FNG03
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	li			 - Cash Revenue Transactions
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/ad15	p	ul		If the Financial Officer discovers that a unit is collecting income or crediting expense based on an unapproved fee or rate, the Financial Officer must consult with theCorporate Controllers Office. Actions may include loss of all income collected through the unapproved fee or a requirement to refund all such income to the parties from whom it was collected.

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			PURPOSE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			A university is inherently a marketplace of ideas, and Penn State encourages and protects the rights of members of the University community to express divergent viewpoints and opinions on matters of concern. At the same time, the University encourages persons engaging in expressive activity to demonstrate civility, concern for the safety of persons and property, and respect for University activities and for those who may disagree with their message.  All persons engaging in expressive activity on University property must  comply with University policies. The purpose of this policy is to provide for expressive activity to be conducted on the grounds of the University in a manner consistent with these principles.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			This policy is applicable to University students, faculty, staff and others who wish to engage in speaking, literature distribution, poster or sign displays, petitioning and similar non commercial activities (generally referred to as expressive activity) at outdoor locations on University property. Use of University buildings and indoor facilities is addressed in other University policies. University grounds and buildings are reserved for use by students, faculty and staff, except as otherwise permitted by policies of the University. Questions concerning this policy should be directed to the Event Management Office, 125D HUB-Robeson Center.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			LOCATIONS FOR EXPRESSIVE ACTIVITY
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Based upon careful study, the following areas of the University Park Campus have been designated as areas suitable for expressive activity:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Old Main front patio
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Allen Street Gate Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Willard Building patio area between Willard and Obelisk
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Palmer Art Museum Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Northwest corner of Shortlidge Rd. and College Avenue
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Fisher Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			IST Plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Pattee Library Mall entrance plaza
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			HUB-Robeson - Rear sidewalk pad (not the Patio)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			HUB-Robeson - Lawn
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Osmond Fountain Area (after 5pm)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Area under the Willaman Gateway to the Life Sciences
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p	ul		At other University locations, the office of the Chancellor, Dean, or other administrator in charge should be consulted to identify the sites suitable for expressive activity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Groups should consider such factors as the number of people involved in the activity, how much space will be required, and the anticipated time and duration of the activity when selecting a location.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			RESERVATION OF LOCATION
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Registered student organizations, or a group of ten or more University students, faculty or staff, may reserve any one of the identified locations for the use of the group, subject to the following:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			All locations (except for Osmond Fountain) may be reserved between the hours of 8:00a.m. and 5:00p.m.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			There are selected areas that can be reserved for hours other than 8:00a.m. - 5:00p.m.. These are HUB Lawn, Old Main Patio and Fisher Plaza. These will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Events at these locations that incur costs from the University can only be reserved by registered student organizations or University Departments.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			A group may reserve only one location for each day.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			The same group may not reserve the same location for more than one day in each calendar week.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Reservation must be requested at least 48 hours in advance of the proposed activity, or by the Friday preceding a Sunday or Monday.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Reservations will be accepted in the order of request, unless considerations of format, size and equitable distribution of locations requires allocation of locations.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Reservation is voluntary but encouraged to avoid conflicts and insure availability.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			The group that has reserved the space has priority over non-reserved groups.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p	ul		Smaller groups and individuals are requested to voluntarily use the designated areas, but may use any outdoor area open to the public that can safely be used so long as noise levels do not conflict with the conduct of University business and crowds do not impede egress and ingress to University facilities.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			With a proper reservation, a group will have exclusive use of the reserved location and may not transfer the reservation to or allow use of the location by any other group. If a location has not been reserved, it will be available for use by a group, consistent with the other requirements of this policy. Registered student organizations and University groups will have absolute priority in the event of conflicting requests.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Registered student organizations, or a group of ten or more University students, faculty or staff, may reserve a location through The Event Management Office, 125D HUB-Robeson Center. Groups wishing to reserve a space other than those designated must submit a written request for an exception to this policy with the appropriate reservation office noted above.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			At non-University Park locations: registered student organizations, or groups of ten or more University students, faculty or staff should contact the Office of Student Affairs to reserve a location. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			NON-UNIVERSITY GROUPS
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			Non-University groups requesting the use of University facilities may pick up the appropriate forms in the Event Management Office, 125 HUB-Robeson Center. After applications are reviewed by appropriate personnel, including those designated with management or assignment responsibility for specific areas, actions relative to the approval are issued through the Office of Strategic Communications, Department of Community Relations. Reservation is voluntary but encouraged to avoid conflicts and insure availability.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			At non-University Park locations:  Non-University groups requesting the use of University facilities should contact the Office of University Relations at the applicable location to request use of / receive approval for the use of a facility. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	a			REQUIREMENTS OF USE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	p			In addition to other University policies and rules that generally apply to students, faculty staff and visitors, the following requirements specifically apply to expressive activities at outdoor locations by individuals and groups:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Use of sound amplification equipment is generally prohibited between 8a.m. and 5p.m. If sound amplification is required for expressive activity, indoor facilities where sound amplification is available may be reserved for use in accordance with University policy. (Amplification is permitted at the Old Main location between the hours of Noon - 1 p.m.)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD51	li			Pedestrian or vehicular traffic must not be impeded in any fashion.

http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			PURPOSE
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	To establish the University's policy prohibiting sex and/or gender-based harassment and misconduct, as well as to define types of misconduct that must be reported. This policy is a companion to University Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			AD91
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			, Discrimination and Harassment and Related Inappropriate Conduct.  
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			POLICY STATEMENT
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			The University is committed to equal access to programs, facilities, admission and employment for all persons.  It is the policy of the University to maintain an environment free of harassment and free of discrimination against any person because of age, race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, creed, service in the uniformed services (as defined in state and federal law), veteran status, sex, sexual orientation, marital or family status, pregnancy, pregnancy-related conditions, physical or mental disability, gender, perceived gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information or political ideas.  Discriminatory conduct and harassment, as well as sexual misconduct and relationship violence, violates the dignity of individuals, impedes the realization of the University’s educational mission, and will not be tolerated. Gender-based and sexual harassment, including sexual violence, are forms of gender discrimination in that they deny or limit an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from University programs or activities.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			This policy shall not be construed to restrict academic freedom at the University, nor shall it be construed to restrict constitutionally protected expression.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Conduct prohibited by this policy may also violate Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as other applicable federal and state laws. Chris Harris is the Title IX Coordinator.  Deputy Title IX Coordinators include Charmelle Green, Senior Associate Athletic Director of Intercollegiate Athletics and Kim Lantz Yoder, Equity Officer, Penn State College of Medicine.  Additional information about how to contact these individuals, or to otherwise pursue or report a violation of this Policy, is set forth below.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Pursuant to this policy and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the University will identify Responsible and Confidential Employees on a regular, ongoing basis, and notify these individuals of their obligations to report (or not report) potential violations.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			The University will provide regular, mandatory training for all University employees related to issues covered under this Policy.  All University employees will be required to complete Title IX training within the first 30 days of employment at the University.  In addition, all University employees will be required to complete an Annual Compliance Training as a reminder of reporting requirements and procedures on a yearly basis.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			CONDUCT THAT IS PROHIBITED BY THIS POLICY (“Prohibited Conduct”)
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span			a. Sexual harassment is defined as follows:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Unwelcome conduct on the basis of sex that is so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to the University’s education program, activity, or employment. OR
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			When an employee of the University conditions the provision of an aid, benefit, or service of the University on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual conduct. OR
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			The conduct rises to the level of sexual assault, as defined in the Clery Act.  This can include any sexual act directed against another person, without the consent of the victims, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent.  It can also include the following:
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em			i. Fondling
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p	ol		 - The touching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or permanent mental incapacity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em			ii. Incest
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span	em		 - Sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span			iii. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em	span		Statutory Rape
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span	em		 - Sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span			iv. 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	em	span		Rape - 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	span	em		The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			b. Gender-Based Harassment is behavior consisting of physical or verbal conduct based on gender, sexual orientation, gender-stereotyping, perceived gender, or gender identity, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, when such conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive such that it substantially interferes with an individual’s employment, education or ability to participate in or benefit from University programs, activities or opportunities and would detrimentally affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances.  Gender-Based Harassment may include, but is not limited to, verbal or physical attacks, graphic or written statements, threats, or slurs. Whether the alleged conduct constitutes prohibited Gender-Based Harassment depends on the totality of the particular circumstances, including the nature, frequency and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs and the status of the individuals involved.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	(Note: Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	 defines Sex and/or Gender-based Discrimination as conduct of any nature that denies an individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of an individual’s employment, education, or living environment, because of the individual’s sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, pregnancy-related condition, gender, perceived gender, or gender identity. Conduct that may constitute Sex and/or Gender-based Discrimination but does not fall within the conduct defined in Policy AD85 is excluded from the definition of Prohibited Conduct in Policy AD85 and is addressed in Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			c. Sexual Misconduct is a form of sexual harassment and refers to sexual offenses including but not limited to rape, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual exploitation, sexual coercion and any other forms of nonconsensual sexual activity.  Sexual misconduct can be committed by strangers, acquaintances and family members, as well as casual and long-term dating partners.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Sexual assault occurs when a person engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with a complainant without the victim’s consent, and includes rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape (as defined above). Sexual assault also includes, but is not limited to, attempted or unwanted sexual activity, such as sexual touching and fondling.  This includes the touching of an unwilling person’s intimate parts (defined as genitalia, groin, breast or buttock, or clothing covering them), or forcing an unwilling person to touch another’s intimate parts.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Sexual exploitation includes, but is not limited to: prostituting another person; non-consensual visual or audio recording of sexual activity; non-consensual display or distribution of photos, images or information of an individual’s sexual activity or intimate body parts; non-consensual voyeurism; coercing someone against their will to engage in sexual activity, or; knowingly transmitting sexually transmitted disease (STD) without disclosing STD status.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Consent must be informed, freely given and mutual.  If coercion, intimidation, threats or physical force are used there is no consent.  If a person is mentally or physically incapacitated or impaired so that such person cannot understand the fact, nature or extent of the sexual situation, there is no consent. This includes impairment or incapacitation due to alcohol or drug consumption, or being asleep or unconscious, where the respondent knew or reasonably should have known that the person was incapacitated.  Inducement of incapacitation of another with the intent to affect the ability of an individual to consent or refuse to consent to sexual contact almost always, if not always, negates consent.  Silence does not necessarily constitute consent.  Whether a person has taken advantage of a position of influence over an alleged victim may be a factor in determining consent.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			d. Stalking is a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his/her safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional distress.  Stalking may include repeatedly following, harassing, threatening, or intimidating another by telephone, mail, electronic communication, social media, or any other action, device or method.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			e. Dating Violence means violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the victim.  The existence of such a relationship will be based on the reporting party’s statement and with consideration of the length and type of relationship and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship.  Dating violence includes but is not limited to sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse.  However, it is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of dating violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Domestic Violence includes crimes of violence committed against a victim by:  (i) a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; (ii) a person with whom the victim shares a child; (iii) a person who is or has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse; (iv) a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim; or (v) any other person (adult or child) against whom the victim is protected under Pennsylvania’s domestic and family violence laws.  It is important to recognize that emotional, verbal, and economic abuse are part of the web of domestic violence and can exist without the presence of physical abuse.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	f. Retaliation, as defined in University Policy 
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			AD67
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			, is also prohibited by this policy and may subject the individual who retaliates in violation of this or other University policy to discipline or sanctions.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			In addition to the above, in the case of off-campus Prohibited Conduct that did not occur in the context of a University program or activity, the University will consider the effects of such off-campus conduct when evaluating whether there is a hostile environment on campus and/or in an off-campus education program or activity.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			CONSENSUAL RELATIONSHIPS
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			While not expressly prohibited, romantic and/or sexual relationships between faculty and students, staff and students or supervisors and subordinate employees are strongly discouraged.  Such relationships have the potential for adverse consequences, including the filing of charges of sexual harassment.  Given the fundamentally asymmetric nature of the relationship where one party has the power to give grades, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases or performance evaluations, the consensual nature of the relationship is inherently suspect.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			Even when both parties have consented to the relationship, there may be perceptions of conflicts of interest or unfair treatment of others. Such perceptions undermine the atmosphere of trust essential to the educational process or the employment relationship. Accordingly, the person in the position of supervision or academic responsibility must promptly report the relationship to his or her immediate supervisor.  Once the consensual relationship is reported, the immediate supervisor is responsible for eliminating or mitigating the conflict of interest to the fullest feasible extent and ensuring that fair and objective processes are in place for decisions relative to grading, thesis advice, evaluations, recommendations, promotions, salary increases, or performance evaluations.  The new supervisory or academic arrangement should be documented.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			RESOURCES AND REPORTING
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			In situations involving danger to persons or property, individuals are strongly encouraged to first report the incident to the applicable police or public safety department.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	a			MANDATORY REPORTING
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p			All Responsible Employees, as defined by this policy, are required to report Prohibited Conduct to the Title IX Coordinator as set forth below.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Confidential Employee – A University employee who is exempt from reporting to the Title IX Coordinator incidents of gender-based harassment, sexual violence, sexual harassment, or any other sexual misconduct in a way that identifies the victim. This includes professional and pastoral counselors and non-professional counselors or advocates. The University designates confidential employees and those individuals are notified of their designation.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Professional and pastoral counselors- includes licensed mental health counselors, pastors, priests, or any other pastoral counselor whose official responsibilities include providing mental health counseling to the campus community. It also includes individuals who are supervised by these people.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	li			Non-professional counselors or advocates- includes individuals who are not professional or pastoral counselors, but work or volunteer in on-campus sexual assault centers, victim advocacy offices, women’s centers, or health centers, including front desk staff and students, social workers, doctors, medical staff, or any other person with a professional license requiring confidentiality.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p	ol		Employees who are designated as Confidential Employees are not required to report any information they learn about an incident involving Prohibited Conduct in a way that identifies the victim.  Some Confidential Employees, such as non-professional counselors or advocates, may be required to report aggregate data only.
http://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD85.html	p		a	For more information, including locations where a list of Confidential Employees may be found, please visit the
