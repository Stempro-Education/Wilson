http://bmats.edu/donor	h2			We Need Your Help
http://bmats.edu/donor	p			BMA Seminary provides an excellent Christ-centered, biblically-based education at tuition rates far below the cost of providing that education. Students only pay a small percentage of the expenses necessary for operating an accredited, world-class seminary. We keep our tuition low (the lowest of any fully accredited evangelical seminary) to help our students graduate without a mountain of debt. We want them to have the financial freedom to pursue God’s calling on their life, regardless of salary.
http://bmats.edu/donor	strong			We need your help
http://bmats.edu/donor	p			 to continue offering Christ-centered education to future generations of ministers and leaders. We need faithful churches and faithful men and women who will help fulfill our mission in Christ’s kingdom.
