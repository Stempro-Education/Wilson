https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	strong			240 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	span			white coats for the class of 2023. Each gift of support launches the career of a first-year medical student in the best possible way. A white coat that is funded by donors like you is a symbolic vote of confidence for these students as they begin their medical careers.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	span			Established by the Arnold P. Gold Foundation, the first ever White Coat Ceremony was held in 1993. The foundation created the ceremony as a way to welcome medical school students into the medical profession. In addition to donning their white coats for the first time, students recite the Hippocratic Oath, reminding them of the sacred promise between caregiver and patient. The gold lapel pin they will receive from the foundation contains an inscription about humanism in medicine--a visual connection to our school's values.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	span		strong	The White Coat ceremony is a special occasion for the entering class of McGovern Medical School and marks the day when over 200 young men and women become first-year medical students. This year's ceremony will be held on 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	strong			Thursday, August 1
https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	span			. We are proud to be McGovern Medical School, where our students can carry on the McGovern ideals of excellence, humanism, and compassion, as they have been since the first White Coat Ceremony at McGovern Medical School in 1996.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/14995	span			We hope you will consider continuing the legacy of the Arnold P. Gold Foundation and support our first-year medical students with a white coat this year.

https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	strong			In 2012, at the age of 24, my baby boy Benjamin lost his life and saved mine.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		em	These are words no father should have to even imagine. This is the truth our family has to face every day for the rest of our lives.

https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em	span		to try and ensure that no other family will have to endure the kind of unspeakable loss that wounded our family.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		em	On July 19, 2012, our lives changed forever. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em			Benjamin rarely complained about pain.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			 Around 9 pm that night, Ben complained of abdominal pain, severe enough that he wanted to get it checked out. A gall bladder issue was suspected and a follow-up test was scheduled. Ben’s pain worsened through the night and his mother and I told him to have his roommates get him to the hospital ASAP.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			His mother Carol met him at the hospital as I stayed with the younger boys. The pain got worse and worse without explanation. A brave mother by his side, Dad at work with no idea what was about to strike. The doors of the family business were locked and I headed to the hospital in a fog, trying to make sense of the words ‘cardiac arrest’ applied to Ben.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		em	By the time I reached the hospital, the emergency was apparently behind us.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em			The doctors said Ben was stable
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			, and gall bladder surgery would be scheduled when he got a little stronger. I left the hospital to pick up Ben’s youngest brother. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	u			In less than an hour, I was called back to the hospital, and by 4pm, our precious Benjamin had left us.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		em	The cardiologist approached me and said something I will never forget, 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em			“Mr. Bradford, I cannot explain what just happened. If I were you, I would have an autopsy done”.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			 In shock, I filled out the necessary papers to send our baby’s body to the Harris County Medical Examiner. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		strong	The coming days came with a whirlwind of information: we were introduced to the term 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	strong			aortic dissection

https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em			no physical explanatio

https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em			have you heard of the John Ritter Research Program (JRRP)
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		strong	Little by little we pieced information together. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	strong			JRRP 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			helped us identify the genetic mutation that Ben had, and that led to his aortic dissection. The whole family was tested and nobody else had the mutation. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			Nonetheless, the family underwent imaging to detect any aortic disease. My two other boys were found to be physically ok. Mom was physically ok. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	em			I, on the other hand, was found to have an aortic aneurysm. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	u	em		The lack of symptoms meant that had my aorta not been imaged as a result of my boy’s death, I would have eventually suffered an aortic dissection
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			. With the sacrifice of his life, my boy alerted the doctors to my condition and saved my life. I am now under the care of the JRRP cardiologist. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	strong			The truth is, had Ben been diagnosed in time, he would have had a fighting chance to stay with us.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span		strong	In his memory, we support the mission of the JRRP. The 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	strong			John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases (JRRP) 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	span			works to prevent premature deaths due to thoracic aortic disease by improving diagnosis, treatment, and public awareness of this disease. The JRRP is led by Dianna M. Milewicz, MD, PhD, who with her team discovered four of the genes that are now known to cause a predisposition for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections that are inherited in families. In addition, the team has identified genetic factors that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections when there is no family history of the disease.
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	u		strong	We need your support to be successful in the effort to help the yet-to-be-identified Benjamins and their families. 
https://launch.uth.edu/project/15805	strong			Please join us in this quest to honor Benjamin’s life and his death.
