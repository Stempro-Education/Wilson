http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	p			Your application is not a set of numbers but an expression of your character, ambitions,                   imagination, and intelligence.                
http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	p			We ask for all of the standard information—recommendations and transcripts—but we                   also ask you to interview and do a good deal of writing. We’re curious about what                   you are thinking, why you are considering early college, and how you approach a critical                   argument.

http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	div		a	Most students apply to the College as 10th and 11th graders. High school seniors are                   eligible to apply in the fall of their senior year in order to start college in our                   spring semester. High school seniors who graduate early or at a young age are also                   eligible to apply. If you are an 8th or 9th grader, consider

http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	span			We encourage students to apply early, and applicants typically hear a decision within                      6-8 weeks of completing their application.

http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	p			The information you provide in your application initiates the conversation with your                               admission counselor. You can start this first step in the application process early,                               up to a year before enrollment.

http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	p			We require four recommendations. Two recommendations must be from high school teachers                               of two different core academic subjects (English, foreign language, math, science,                               or social studies); one must be from a current teacher. The third, nonacademic recommendation                               is completed by someone who knows you outside of the academic setting, other than                               a family member. The fourth is completed by your school guidance counselor.

http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	p			Our experience has been that the decision to attend Simon’s Rock is best made after                               a serious discussion between the applicant and his/her/their family. Invite your parent                               or guardian to fill out their recommendation.

http://www.simons-rock.edu/admission/how-to-apply/index.php	p		a	Your guidance counselor will submit this report with your transcript. Your application                               will not be considered complete until we receive current year grades, i.e. first semester/trimester                               or the midyear grade report. In most cases, these are available after early November                               (semester system) or early December (trimester system). If your school does not include                               this with your school report and transcript, please request to have these emailed                               to
