https://calvin.edu/arts	h2			Why we make art
https://calvin.edu/arts	h3		span	You were created 
https://calvin.edu/arts	span			to create
https://calvin.edu/arts	span			Make things new
https://calvin.edu/arts	p			This world has cracks and flaws. It is endlessly imperfect. Art has the potential to revive, reconnect, and restore what is broken. At Calvin, we take that power seriously. Our poems give words a new heart. Our paintings turn issues into understanding. Our films build relationships. Our arias renew weary souls. Through art—in all its powerful forms—we tangibly renew God’s creation.
https://calvin.edu/arts	span			Provoke action
https://calvin.edu/arts	p			Can the arts make a city a better place to live? Free the oppressed? Reconcile inequality? At Calvin, we approach the arts with the bold belief that creative work is meant to serve God and others by questioning the status quo, challenging injustices, and actively working to make the world more like God intended it to be.
https://calvin.edu/arts	span			Revel in beauty
https://calvin.edu/arts	p			Great creative work draws you to a deeper place—a place of unfettered emotion and boundless joy. Through vibrant offerings in the arts—concerts, films, festivals, theatre performances, and more—Calvin invites you to revel in creative culture, believe in its ability to do good, and experience it as much more than entertainment.

https://calvin.edu/vision2030	h2			Vision 2030: Calvin University
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			This was the first outcome of a visioning process that helped us prepare for our next strategic plan. Our campus community gathered to talk about our challenges and opportunities in light of our strengths and our identity as an institution. Ultimately, we asked, “What will Calvin look like in 2030?”
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			As a result of community conversations, we created the following vision:
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			By 2030, Calvin will become a Christian liberal arts university with an expanded global influence. We envision Calvin University as a trusted partner for learning across religious and cultural differences and throughout the academy, the church, and the world. Calvin University will be animated by a Reformed Christian faith that seeks understanding and promotes the welfare of the city and the healing of the world. We welcome all who are compelled by God’s work of renewal to join us in the formative pursuits of lifelong learning, teaching, scholarship, worship, and service.

https://calvin.edu/vision2030	h2			Three ways we’ll grow
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			Calvin’s 2030 vision is full of innovation and possibilities. And while the details of this vision, and the path to achieve it, will be the job of the next strategic plan, we are excited about the vision’s three areas of focus:
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	h3			University status
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p		i	Calvin took the initial step in 2019 to become known as 
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	i			Calvin University
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			. But this transition is about much more than a name change. Discussions are already underway about what structural and governance changes will help us expand what we do well and experiment with new directions.
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			In many ways the college had already operated like a university, in organization and caliber. Renaming our institution as a university enhances our reputation and more accurately reflects the depth and variety of our educational work to external audiences.
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	h3			Trusted partner
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p		i	Calvin University aims to grow as a 
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	i			trusted partner.
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			 We desire to be a sought-after source for knowledge and resources for curious learners all over the globe. We want to be able to come alongside groups of all different Christian traditions, all over the world and ask how we can best partner with them to promote flourishing in the world. 
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			Historically, the Calvin community has had a deep expertise in a variety of areas that can be matched with needs in our city, in our nation, and places across the globe. In the coming years we will redouble our efforts to seek mutually beneficial relationships with communities and institutions to promote redemption, justice, and the truth of Christ. 
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			We want to be able to come alongside groups from all different Christian traditions, in all cultural and global contexts, and ask how we can best partner with them to promote flourishing in the world.
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	h3			Reformed identity
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p		i	Calvin University aims to become 
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	i			the
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			 source for Reformed Christian thinking in the world. While it may be countercultural, we believe with all our heart that the world needs a Reformed Christian transformational vision. 
https://calvin.edu/vision2030	p			Calvin has long aspired to honor God’s sovereignty over all things and to work in and under the broad, covenantal reach of Scripture. To that end, we are expanding on our commitment to teach from a Reformed Christian perspective to become a resource for Reformed Christian thought leadership.
