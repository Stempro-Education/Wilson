https://www.tkc.edu	div			A CHRISTIAN COLLEGE LIKE NO OTHER 
https://www.tkc.edu	p			Through its commitment to the truths of Christianity and a biblical worldview, The King’s College seeks to transform society by preparing students for careers in which they help to shape and eventually lead strategic public and private institutions, and by supporting faculty members as they directly engage culture through writing and speaking publicly on critical issues.
https://www.tkc.edu	span			Academics
https://www.tkc.edu	span			We seek greatness in all our endeavors.
https://www.tkc.edu	p		a	Our strategic academic programs are based on our 
https://www.tkc.edu	p		a	. All students take these courses as the basis of our nine academic majors. As students further their intellectual and vocational exploration, they may also choose from 15 
https://www.tkc.edu	a			minors
https://www.tkc.edu	p			Our courses are taught by Christian faculty members who are accomplished in their fields and who bring cross-disciplinary perspectives to their classes.

https://www.tkc.edu	span			THERE'S NOWHERE LIKE KING'S, BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE LIKE NEW YORK.
https://www.tkc.edu	p			At our Christian college in New York City, we believe we should be shaping culture at its heart. Here in the heart of the metropolis, we believe we have that chance. King’s offers academic immersion at a small liberal arts college, amazing internships and job opportunities — plus the chance to truly influence secular society in the world’s most global city.

https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	a			Dr. Steele Brand Book Launch and Lunch – Killing for the Republic: Citizen-Soldiers and the Roman Way of War
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		i	Join The King’s College community as we hear from Dr. Steel Brand regarding his book, 
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	a			Killing for the Republic: Citizen-Soldiers and the Roman Way of War
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		b	, on Friday, January 31 from 12:15 PM to 1:15 PM in the 5th Floor City Room. Doors open at 12:00 PM, and lunch is provided. Registration required. 
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	a			REGISTER HERE.
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	About Dr. Steele Brand
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	Steele Brand is Assistant Professor of History at The King’s College in New York City, where he teaches courses on the ancient Mediterranean world and medieval Europe. He received his PhD from Baylor University, his MA from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, and his BA from Texas A&M University. He previously served as the Director of Undergraduate Fellows for the Clements Center for National Security and as a tactical intelligence officer.
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	Brand’s research focuses on the relationship between farming, citizenship, and soldiering. Constitutional polities—especially premodern, agrarian republics—cultivated a unique set of virtues and a deadly form of civic militarism that created tough citizens who were as involved in politics as they were proficient at defending their political system. Brand has written on these themes in his forthcoming book, Killing for the Republic: Citizen-Soldiers and the Roman Way of War. He has also published articles in journals such as Religions and Humanitas about how this premodern ideal of citizen-soldiers has informed and inspired modern republics, particularly the United States.
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	His teaching explores how the public life of the spirit binds people together within a polity. His classes also emphasize how these polities or collections of polities (civilizations) intersect in the great diplomatic and military events of history. And because the lives of specific individuals so often reflect and define this broader narrative, he uses anecdotes, primary source readings, and film to illuminate how certain men and women—often unexpectedly—directed the course of their people’s story.
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		a	Steele lives in his Hunterdon County hobbit hole with his wife and five shirelings. For more information about Steele and his research, see

https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		i	About 
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	"""For who is so worthless or indolent as not to wish to know by what means and under what system of polity the Romans... succeeded in subjecting nearly the whole inhabited world to their sole government―a thing unique in history?""―Polybius"
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	The year 146 BC marked the brutal end to the Roman Republic's 118-year struggle for the western Mediterranean. Breaching the walls of their great enemy, Carthage, Roman troops slaughtered countless citizens, enslaved those who survived, and leveled the 700-year-old city. That same year in the east, Rome destroyed Corinth and subdued Greece. Over little more than a century, Rome's triumphant armies of citizen-soldiers had shocked the world by conquering all of its neighbors.
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	How did armies made up of citizen-soldiers manage to pull off such a major triumph? And what made the republic so powerful? In Killing for the Republic, Steele Brand explains how Rome transformed average farmers into ambitious killers capable of conquering the entire Mediterranean. Rome instilled something violent and vicious in its soldiers, making them more effective than other empire builders. Unlike the Assyrians, Persians, and Macedonians, it fought with part-timers. Examining the relationship between the republican spirit and the citizen-soldier, Brand argues that Roman republican values and institutions prepared common men for the rigors and horrors of war.
https://www.tkc.edu/calendar	p		br	Brand reconstructs five separate battles―representative moments in Rome's constitutional and cultural evolution that saw its citizen-soldiers encounter the best warriors of the day, from marauding Gauls and the Alps-crossing Hannibal to the heirs of Alexander the Great. A sweeping political and cultural history, Killing for the Republic closes with a compelling argument in favor of resurrecting the citizen-soldier ideal in modern America.

http://www.tkc.edu/visit	p		a	New York City has three major airports:
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	a			 LaGuardia (LGA),
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	a			Kennedy (JFK),
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	p		a	 and 
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	a			Newark (EWR).
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	p			 Flying into any of them is easy, and you can get ground transportation from your airport to Manhattan with very little trouble.
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	p			We recommend that our guests fly into LaGuardia Airport (LGA). Catching a cab from LaGuardia to the Financial District is very simple and costs about $50.
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	p			Public transportation from LaGuardia is also an option, but it requires a transfer that can be difficult if you are carrying several bags. Take the M60 Bus from the airport to the Astoria Blvd/Hoyt Ave stop in Astoria. There, you can switch to the N or Q train.
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	span			Manhattan By Train
http://www.tkc.edu/visit	p			New York City has two main rail stations in Midtown: Grand Central Terminal (on the east side) and Penn Station (on the west side). Each is also served by numerous subway lines. Grand Central is served by Metro-North Railroad, which goes to NYC suburbs in New York and Connecticut. Penn Station is served by the following: Long Island Rail Road, Amtrak, and NJ Transit.
