https://launch.drew.edu	h2			What is Launch?
https://launch.drew.edu	p			Drew recognizes that personal networks, community engagement, transferable skills, and relevant experiences are just as essential to college as they are to career. Recent research backs us up: Networking leads to 85% of jobs. Transferable skills—like critical thinking and interpersonal communication—are among the competencies most valued by employers and graduate school. And candidates with meaningful experiences are the preferred hires of 94% of employers and are more successful graduate and professional school applicants. Launch ensures that every Drew student graduates connected, cultivated and capable for today’s workplace. Your world is diverse, so your community connections are diverse.
https://launch.drew.edu	h2			Essential Elements of Launch
https://launch.drew.edu	span			This is the go-to hub for networking with others and connecting with events, resources and opportunities in 10 broad career areas. Who will you meet here? A career-focused crew of students, alumnx, faculty and more.
https://launch.drew.edu	span			Our curated online spaces bring together people with a shared life path, helping them to create diverse, supportive networks of empathy and opportunity. And everyone—students, alumnx, faculty and more—is welcome.
https://launch.drew.edu	a			Network of Mentors
https://launch.drew.edu	span			About 85% of jobs today are filled via networking. Launch gives students a competitive edge, guiding them in the development of a diverse network of mentors while still in college. (Build it at Drew; take it with you.)
https://launch.drew.edu	a			Immersive Experiences
https://launch.drew.edu	span			At least two career-building immersions—we’re talking internships, research, study abroad and more—are guaranteed in Launch. Our students leave Drew with the meaningful experience preferred by 94% of employers hiring new college grads.
https://launch.drew.edu	a			Transferable Skills
https://launch.drew.edu	span			Our students learn a set of sought-after workplace skills that flex across life and career. That’s key for today’s generation, who can expect to change jobs (and even industries) about 12 times in their working careers.
https://launch.drew.edu	a			Launch Plan
https://launch.drew.edu	span			This exclusive online space allows Drew students to create (and refine) an action plan connecting their purpose with life and career paths to achieve it. Guided, along the way, by a network of advisers,instructors, and mentors.
