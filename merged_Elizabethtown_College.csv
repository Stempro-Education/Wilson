https://www.etown.edu/clery	p		em	The 
https://www.etown.edu/clery	em			Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act
https://www.etown.edu/clery	p			, is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime and security policies. All public and private institutions of post secondary education participating in federal student aid programs are subject to it.
https://www.etown.edu/clery	p		span	The Clery Act was signed into law in 1990 as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990. Amendments to the Act in 1998 renamed it in memory of Jeanne Clery, who was murdered at Lehigh University in 1986. The law 
https://www.etown.edu/clery	span			was supported by Jeanne's parents, Howard & Connie Clery, who 
https://www.etown.edu/clery	p		strong	also founded the non-profit Security On Campus, Inc. in 1987, which is now known as the 
https://www.etown.edu/clery	a			Clery Center. 
https://www.etown.edu/clery	h3			Annual Security and Fire Safety Report
https://www.etown.edu/clery	p			Each institution of higher education in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is required to annually publish specific data relating to the number per capita rate of certain types of crime reported to have occurred at the institution, and the security measures that are in place to reduce the risk of criminal victimization for members of the community. Additionally, this report addresses requirements of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act. Elizabethtown College's Clery Committee meets periodically throughout the summer and early fall to review appropriate resources from the Clery Center, develop an outline for the report and evaluate and revise report content as needed and publish the report no later than October 1.
https://www.etown.edu/clery	h3			Daily Crime and Fire Log
https://www.etown.edu/clery	p		a	Campus Security maintains a combined Daily Crime Log and Fire Log of all crimes, fire-related incidents, and other serious incidents that occur on campus and have been reported to Elizabethtown College Department of Campus Security. The daily crime and fire log includes the date and time the report was received, the date and time the incident occurred, the nature of the offense, the location of the offense and disposition if available. The log can be viewed at the Campus Security Office during regular business hours (8am-5pm Monday through Friday, except Holidays), 605 South Mount Joy Street or anytime online by

http://www.etown.edu/clery	em			Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act
http://www.etown.edu/clery	p			, is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime and security policies. All public and private institutions of post secondary education participating in federal student aid programs are subject to it.
http://www.etown.edu/clery	p		span	The Clery Act was signed into law in 1990 as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990. Amendments to the Act in 1998 renamed it in memory of Jeanne Clery, who was murdered at Lehigh University in 1986. The law 
http://www.etown.edu/clery	span			was supported by Jeanne's parents, Howard & Connie Clery, who 
http://www.etown.edu/clery	p		strong	also founded the non-profit Security On Campus, Inc. in 1987, which is now known as the 
http://www.etown.edu/clery	a			Clery Center. 
http://www.etown.edu/clery	h3			Annual Security and Fire Safety Report
http://www.etown.edu/clery	p			Each institution of higher education in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is required to annually publish specific data relating to the number per capita rate of certain types of crime reported to have occurred at the institution, and the security measures that are in place to reduce the risk of criminal victimization for members of the community. Additionally, this report addresses requirements of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act. Elizabethtown College's Clery Committee meets periodically throughout the summer and early fall to review appropriate resources from the Clery Center, develop an outline for the report and evaluate and revise report content as needed and publish the report no later than October 1.
http://www.etown.edu/clery	h3			Daily Crime and Fire Log
http://www.etown.edu/clery	p		a	Campus Security maintains a combined Daily Crime Log and Fire Log of all crimes, fire-related incidents, and other serious incidents that occur on campus and have been reported to Elizabethtown College Department of Campus Security. The daily crime and fire log includes the date and time the report was received, the date and time the incident occurred, the nature of the offense, the location of the offense and disposition if available. The log can be viewed at the Campus Security Office during regular business hours (8am-5pm Monday through Friday, except Holidays), 605 South Mount Joy Street or anytime online by
