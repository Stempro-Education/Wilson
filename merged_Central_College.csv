https://forever.central.edu	h1			Why We're Forever Dutch
https://forever.central.edu	h2			Dave ’61 and Ardie Pals Sutphen ’64
https://forever.central.edu	strong			Dave ’61 and Ardie Pals Sutphen ’64
https://forever.central.edu	p			 are passionate about Central students and the Dutch!
https://forever.central.edu	p			Ardie served the college from 1979-2012, primarily as assistant to the president.
https://forever.central.edu	p			Dave joined the Central staff in 2000 and retired as vice president of advancement in 2013. He continues in retirement as major gifts advisor.
https://forever.central.edu	p			The Sutphens are among the top donors to Forever Dutch.
https://forever.central.edu	p			“It is about facilities, but the most important thing is the people and the difference Central makes in these students’ lives,” Dave says. “I get to see it first-hand. I’ve been involved with Central since I came as a student in 1957. Ardie and I just believe in this place, and we believe in our students and coaches. They are absolutely fantastic and we need to support them.”
https://forever.central.edu	p			Dave ’61 and Ardie Pals Sutphen ’64
https://forever.central.edu	h2			Game-changing facilities
https://forever.central.edu	h2			Life-changing experiences
https://forever.central.edu	p			It’s not just the trophies and titles that make Central athletics special. It’s the growth, relationships and life lessons. The spectacular $12-million P.H. Kuyper Gymnasium expansion enhances those opportunities.
https://forever.central.edu	h2			But the game's not over
https://forever.central.edu	p		strong	The building is incomplete without the critical work necessary to give the original 50-year-old structure an 
https://forever.central.edu	strong			urgently needed transformation into a championship 21st-century facility.
https://forever.central.edu	h1			Renovation
https://forever.central.edu	h2			RENOVATED LOCKER ROOMS
https://forever.central.edu	p			The new varsity locker room in the gymnasium expansion is spectacular. But it’s only a partial answer. Central’s men’s and women’s teams can access it only half of the year. A total renovation and reconfiguration of the old women’s space will create a matching, dynamic new varsity locker room, tailored to the needs of Central’s female student-athletes. Student recreational locker rooms also need a refresh.
https://forever.central.edu	h2			RENOVATED ATHLETIC TRAINING ROOM
https://forever.central.edu	p			A renovated athletic training room will feature a redesigned floor plan providing for more space and efficiency. The modernized facility will also enhance its educational value.
https://forever.central.edu	h2			SUITES/CONFERENCE ROOMS
https://forever.central.edu	p			In addition to meeting space, two suites overlooking the gymnasium will provide space to host events and prospective students.
https://forever.central.edu	h2			COACHES’ OFFICES
https://forever.central.edu	p			Central’s coaches presently have to bring recruits to offices that are undersized and outdated. All new offices are part of the rebuild, including a new football coaches’ suite.
https://forever.central.edu	h2			SIKKINK-DYKSTRA WELCOME CENTER
https://forever.central.edu	p			The main athletics department reception area will provide an open and inviting space for students, prospective students, families and other visitors.
https://forever.central.edu	blockquote		cite	           Completing these renovations is not only important for our student-athletes, it is critical to the future of Central College.           
https://forever.central.edu	strong			Eric Van Kley
https://forever.central.edu	cite			Director of Athletics
https://forever.central.edu	h2			The legacy of the Kuyper, Farver and Griffith extended family
https://forever.central.edu	p			The descendants of Pella Corporation founder P.H. “Pete” Kuyper, along with their family foundations, teamed for a transformational $4.2-million gift for the Forever Dutch initiative, the largest gift in Central’s 164-year history.
https://forever.central.edu	p			The donation included a lead gift from the late M. Joan Farver, former chair of Pella Corporation and long-time Central trustee. Joan, who passed away Feb. 27, 2017, at the age of 97, was the daughter of P.H. Kuyper. The new atrium is named in her honor – the M. Joan Kuyper Farver Atrium, adding her name to those of other prominent family members. The A.N. Kuyper Athletics Complex is named for Farver’s grandfather, while H.S. Kuyper Fieldhouse carries the name of her brother.
https://forever.central.edu	a			The Kuyper Family Legacy
