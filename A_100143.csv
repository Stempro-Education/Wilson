http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	em			Submit your free online application to Belmont Abbey College today and be a part of something extraordinary.
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Step one: Submit Your Application
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			The first step is to submit your application. Belmont Abbey College’s application is free to submit online. An essay is not required for initial submission. You will be prompted to create a CFNC (College Foundation of North Carolina) account. This is a free account and it allows you to work on your application over time.
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	b			You have two options for applying to The Abbey
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	p		b	: All students applying prior up until October 30 will be 
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	b			Early Action*
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			 candidates, and will find out their admissions decision by mail, and electronically on November 1, 2019. After November 1st, all applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, and students who submit their application can expect an admissions decision within one week of completing their file.
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	h3			Step two: Submit Your Transcript & Test Scores
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	p			The second step is to submit your official transcript and official standardized test scores (we accept the SAT, ACT and CLT). Your transcript needs to include the name of your school, your personal information, a detailed list of the classes you have taken throughout your high school years along with the letter grade you received for each class.
http://belmontabbeycollege.edu/admissions/apply	i			* Early Action is a non-binding program that allows you to find out your     admissions decision early in the fall of your senior year. Merit scholarships, institutional grants, state and federal aid that Belmont Abbey offers is available to both Early Action and Rolling Admissions candidates. However, priority consideration for institutional grant money are given to students who fill out, and file FAFSA prior to February 1, 2020. Students who haven’t taken an ACT, SAT, or CLT exam are eligible to apply for Early Action.

Merit scholarships, institutional grants, state and federal aid that Belmont Abbey offers is available to both Early Action and Rolling Admissions candidates. However, priority consideration for institutional grant money are given to students who fill out, and file FAFSA prior to February 1, 2020. Students who haven’t taken an ACT, SAT, or CLT exam are eligible to apply for Early Action.
