https://dc.hillsdale.edu/Alumni	h2			Featured Alum
https://dc.hillsdale.edu/Alumni	h3			Noah Weinrich, Class of 2018, Press Secretary for Heritage Action for America
https://dc.hillsdale.edu/Alumni	p			“Most people don't think studying Plato would help in writing press releases, but it does. Studying English, philosophy, journalism, economics, and more in the core curriculum gave me a broad range of skills and helped me learn to adapt and succeed in new tasks. Hillsdale classes also taught me how to see through the simplistic narratives we tell ourselves and our children, and how to understand our current moment in the context of millennia of human experience.”
https://dc.hillsdale.edu/Alumni	p			“While it's very different from our college years, the alumni base is an extension of the collegial spirit that brought us together at Hillsdale in the first place. I wouldn't trade my college years for the world, and I can't imagine a life without my community in D.C.”
