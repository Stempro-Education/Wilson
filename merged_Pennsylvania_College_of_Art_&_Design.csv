http://pcad.edu/discover	h2			Small college, big reach
http://pcad.edu/discover	p			When you meet our faculty and students, it becomes abundantly clear that they value not only the process of art and design, but its extraordinary value in the world.
http://pcad.edu/discover	p			Even more, PCA&D’s value extends beyond campus. You’ll enjoy living and learning in Lancaster, PA — a small, historical city that cherishes artists and pulsates with creativity. As you pursue your degree, you’ll be embraced by the diverse neighbors, businesses, and galleries that populate our city’s energetic downtown corridor.
http://pcad.edu/discover	p			When you graduate with the BFA, you’ll have developed an extensive network of fellow alumni and professional contacts to tap into. And you will continue to live a life in art as you go on to become a respected contributor in your creative industry.

http://pcad.edu/discover	strong			Teaching Philosophy:
http://pcad.edu/discover	p			 It is extremely important to understand how to represent the basic fundamentals of a subject in order to abstract it.  The strength in every project comes from being educated in the importance of drawing and design.

http://pcad.edu/discover	p			 Art is about lifelong learning; about oneself and others, about what has come before us as well as the possibilities for the future. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “The production of a work of art sheds light upon the mystery of humanity.”

http://pcad.edu/discover	span			Teaching is a privilege and opportunity to educate and inspire. 
http://pcad.edu/discover	span	span		My goal is not only to impart to my students a great education, but also a belief and confidence in themselves so they can make a difference. 
http://pcad.edu/discover	span	span		I encourage them to solve problems, discover opportunities and create work that will make them proud to call themselves artists.
