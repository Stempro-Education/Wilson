https://www.bluefieldstate.edu/wvrocks	p			NOTE: Birthdates from January–September may have been imported into the system as a five-digit number mddyy. If this exception applies to you and the six-digit birthdate doesn’t work, please try the five-digit sequence as your initial password before calling the WVNET Help Desk (304-293-5192). Likewise, if you are a returning user and your old password no longer works, try logging in with your birthdate just in case the batch enrollment process overwrites your old password.
https://www.bluefieldstate.edu/wvrocks	p			Once you have successfully logged into the WVROCKS portal, you can change your password by clicking on the person icon to the right of your name in the upper right corner of your screen. This will take you to “My Places,” and from there you will click on “Personal Information” and follow the steps to change your password.

http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	strong			Bluefield State College Receives $1.5 Million POWER grant from Appalachian Regional Commission
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			On June 14, 2017, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) announced $15.7 million in POWER (Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization ) Initiative grants, including a $1.5 million award to Bluefield State College for the establishment of the Center for Excellence in Manufacturing Engineering (CEME). Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Technology and Engineering Management Jeff McFadden was the lead author of the proposal and will helm the project as its Executive Director.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			The core component of the CEME will be degree and workforce training programs in Manufacturing Engineering Technology (MFGT). First to be implemented will be a 2 2 program, in which the student earns a 2-year associate degree in one of the other engineering programs offered through BSC's School of Engineering Technology and Computer Science, (electrical, mechanical) and spends an additional 2 years in MFGT coursework to achieve the bachelor’s degree. As course offerings build, a 4-year bachelor's-degree program will be added.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			As well as appealing to young people preparing for their first career, the CEME has a specific intention to transition workers displaced from mining-sector jobs into manufacturing. The framework is to leverage the skills (welding, equipment maintenance and installation, knowledge of hydraulics, operation of computer controlled equipment, etc.) displaced mine workers possess as transferable to other areas of manufacturing and industry. On this foundation, the MFGT program will build field-specific and state-of-the-art skills such that the graduate is highly marketable to emerging industries. This degree program will provide graduates the opportunity to rebrand themselves for future infusion into both existing and new market areas.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			In recognition of the fact that not all transitioning workers need or desire a bachelor's degree, the CEME will also offer certificate programs (seminars and workshops) designed to give non-degree-seeking students mastery over a narrow subject area or topic. In addition to courses on a number of general topics, such as computer programming, quality, solid modeling, robotics, and project management, the CEME will work with local manufacturers to design special courses on specific technical topics.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			In addition to degree and workforce training, CEME activities will including consulting and research components. Just as individual workers have been displaced by downturns in coal mining, so have many businesses that provide manufacturing support to the industry. The CEME will offer consulting services to help these companies transition into new areas of manufacturing. Services will also be available to established industries in the form of advising in the streamlining and optimization of existing manufacturing operations.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			The CEME will also serve as a research and development arm for local industry, with collaborative robotics as its major research focus. Traditionally, industrial robotic applications and installations have been required to be physically isolated from human workers. Collaborative robotics is an area of development that seeks to eliminate the cost and inefficiencies of this system by using advanced redundant presence sensing systems to allow humans and robots to work side-by-side without compromising worker safety.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p			By supplying expertise and a pool of highly-qualified workers, this program will help local companies innovate, successfully develop new product lines, streamline existing services, replace an aging workforce, and strengthen the existing infrastructure of manufacturing in the southern portion of the state and surrounding area as it repositions itself to become a center of manufacturing excellence.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP	p		a	Students and businesses interested in CEME activities should contact Jeff McFadden, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Technology and Engineering Management at 304-327-4128 or

http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	h4			When should I start working on my grant application?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	p			The earlier you start the better for you and your chances for success.

You hold primary responsibility for the technical conduct of the project, and for administrative and budgetary management. However, RASP is always happy to help answer your questions and will provide guidance and assistance at every stage of the process.
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	h4			What is WIRB? 
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	p			Western Institutional Review Board or WIRB is what our office uses for an Institutional Review Board (IRB). You can check out “Guide for Researchers” on our Guides page that tells you all about WIRB.

http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	h4			How do I determine if my research involves human subjects? 
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	p			Determining this can be surprisingly complicated and depends on a variety of factors. There are a number of questions to think about as you determine whether you will need IRB approval:
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			"Does my work involve human subjects? For purposes of IRB review, a ""human subject"" is defined as ""a living individual about whom an investigator conducting research obtains (1) data through interaction or intervention with the individual or (2) identifiable private information."" (45.CFR 46.102)."
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			"Is my work research? For purposes of IRB review, ""research"" is defined as ""a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge."" (45.CFR 46.102)."
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			Do you intend to collect information and then present it to a public audience or at a conference?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			Do you intend to publish findings or disseminate information based upon your work?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			Will you be conducting interviews, surveys or focus groups?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			Will you need access to sensitive data or records?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			Is there any way to link the data you plan to collect with identifying information?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	li			Are you seeking grant funding?
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	h4	ul		Where can I find information about misconduct?

http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	p		a	Find helpful information in 
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	a			Policy 53
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	h4			I just have a small grant. Does it need to go through RASP? 
http://bluefieldstate.edu/resources/RASP/FAQ	p			Yes! Even if you don't require our assistance preparing your proposal, we need to know about your project for a number of reasons.  As more and more people on campus participate in grant writing, we need to have a central repository to ensure that we're not duplicating efforts.  We also need to be able to brag about our grant writing successes to other agencies when we apply to them.
