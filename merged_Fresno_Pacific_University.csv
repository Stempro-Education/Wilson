https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	At its October Board meeting the Fresno Pacific University Board of Trustees affirmed the Strategic Plan revisions, which are now identified as the FPU Strategic Map 2019-2022. Over the past two years students, staff, faculty and trustees have provided input for clarity in institutional direction. The university’s revised 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	a			vision statement approved in June 2016
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	 and the 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Fresno Pacific Idea
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 are the driving forces that framed the overarching goals of the map. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	 Over this next semester, we will dedicate each 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Connections
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 to highlighting progress, plans and projections on the work toward our five goals. I will introduce the goal during the first week of each month followed by colleagues across campus who will address the objectives. We will hear from members of our community about strategic implementation, proposed innovations and progress toward objectives. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	 Following the acronym GEIST, which identifies the goals, we will introduce each goal with its objectives. During the month of January, we will review

https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	ERVE Courageously; and May – 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	RANSFORM Purposely. The five goals (GEIST), inspires our community in corporate application and cooperation to strengthen our resolve to actualize the 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Idea
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 We expect contributions and support in each of these areas across the university. Departments and divisions will provide annual action plans which will be assessed at the end of each semester. All work in these areas will be posted on the institutional website. A review of our progress will be reported at the end of each academic year and during the State of the University Report.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	strong			As a reminder, the University Vision Statement approved June 2016 is as follows: 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	Fresno Pacific is a vibrant Christ-centered university that is transforming California’s Central Valley and global communities through exemplary service to students of all ethnicities and cultures. Innovative programs encourage academic and professional excellence, peacemaking, social justice, ethical leadership, holistic wellness and spiritual vitality.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	Goal One: 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	strong			GROW Strategically
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back, lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes…Do not be afraid, you will not be put to shame
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 (Isaiah 54:2,4).
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	 We have broadened our borders from Merced to Bakersfield. Now we must steward the ground we have gained. The 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 challenges us to extend the influence of the Kingdom of God through our students. One way to extend that influence throughout the Central Valley is to expand opportunities for high school and community college students to obtain bachelor’s degrees. Our accelerated programs at our regional campuses have grown through those who have left community colleges at some point and decided to pursue a degree later in life.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 Research by the College Futures Foundation reveals that increased four-year degrees are vital to the economic development of the Central Valley. Numerous students who apply to the CSUs and UCs are experiencing increasing difficulty in securing a place at a four-year university. Most recently over 74,000 students who were eligible for the CSUs and UCs could not find a place due to the lack of capacity of the publics to serve. The Futures report is expecting this demand to increase and has identified the Central Valley as one of the two most critical areas. The state and regional communities have identified a critical need where FPU is able to grow capacity and serve. This extended growth will testify to our commitment to engage the cultures and serve the cities in the region.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			  There are four objectives under Goal One:
https://blogs.fresno.edu	li			Increase the overall average student population to 5,000 students per semester, including 1,200 TUG students.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	li	li		Increase scholarship/annual fund revenue through a comprehensive fund development plan which includes greater alumni participation, broader donor-base and grant development.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	li	li		Expand revenue streams that support improvement of academic programs and innovative initiatives.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	li	li		Build and restore facilities that aid recruitment, encourage alumni loyalty and strengthen the university’s image.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	We trust that these 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	 in the coming semester will be informative and keep the FPU community abreast to our corporate progress in meeting each objective. The approved Strategic Map is posted on the 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	a			President’s
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	 page on the intranet. The President’s Cabinet will be inviting members of the community to contribute to this media dialogue over this spring semester.

https://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Popular Histories for Understanding and Teaching
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I have to confess most often I do not like “popular histories.”  I have been trained to read dull, dry, technical works of history in my fields of study, and I find popular histories often misleading, and without the understanding of the mentality, questions, problems, institutions, and limitations of the times they are writing about necessary to write insightful history.  Many of our professions, not just in academia, have similar occupational hazards. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			But I make an effort to read popular histories to gain ideas and insights into how to teach the subjects I have the privilege of discussing each week with students, often in introductory courses.  Popular histories offer models of communication of difficult subjects for non-specialists and provide ways of developing a subject in the classroom.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			This last year I have read a few that I can recommend to my current and former students.  These have the benefit of being by academically trained writers who want to present their subjects accurately and with some depth, but also to communicate with broad audiences. They are sensitive not to politicize their arguments, but also to address their subjects in ways that allow their readers to recognize the complexities of the political world we live in and make judgements about how we should understand and respond when needed.  Here are three about the Middle East that I have read in the last year that I hope some readers of this blog might find interesting.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	The first is on a large topic, Islamic governmental order throughout its history, Hugh Kennedy’s (University of London) 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Caliphate: The History of an Idea 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	(Basic Books, 2016). A “caliph” is the successor of the prophet Mohammed in leading the Muslim community (though not as a prophet) and a deputy of God.  Kennedy focuses on three questions, how a caliph should be chosen, “what should the caliph do and how extensive were his powers to be,” and how these questions were to be decided and on what evidence choices would be made. He develops the variations in answers to each of them, bringing the story up to the 21
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 century and the proclamation of the restoration of the caliphate by ISIS. That story adds great depth to our understanding of a very large and powerful political tradition, and how we might understand the conflicts and claims we see today.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	The second and third each focus on individual cities: Thomas F. Madden of St. Louis University, a historian of the crusades, 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Istanbul: City of Majesty at the Crossroads of the World 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	(Viking, 2016) and Simon Sebag Montefiore, 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Jerusalem: The Biography 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	(Vintage, 2011).  Madden describe “The City” (the meaning of Istanbul) from ancient times, through its centuries as Constantinople the capital of Byzantine civilization and its Ottoman centuries, to the 20
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	 century as the capital of secular, modern Turkey, and the 21
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 as Turkey has returned overtly to Islam under Erdogan. Madden illustrates the power of the city that was feared in Reformation Europe and a source of mystery before and after. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	Montefiore, likewise develops a history of Jerusalem from its ancient centuries as the city of David, Solomon and other Israelite kings, through New Testament times, to Islamic centuries where it was sometimes a religious center, sometimes the place of conflict (the crusades and between competing Muslim political leaders) and when it was a forgotten, dusty, small town in a desert.  He brings the story up to 2010, with it now as a Jewish and Muslim city, a place passionate claims, tension, violence, intense archaeological work, and cherished sites for worship. You can find a presentation of the book and how he wrote it by Montefiore at 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	a			C-Span
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			All of these offer understanding without the technicalities and arguments of academic works.  Each is engagingly written and rewards anytime we spend with them.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	One more written just last year might be added. It too is by an academic historian, written for a popular audience, and focuses on a topic of interest today, Robert Louis Wilken’s (Emeritus, University of Virginia) 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Liberty in the Things of God: The Christian Origins of Religious Freedom
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 (Yale, 2019).  Today when the media narrative is that religion and Christianity is inherently oppressive and violent, Wilken tells the story of how arguments for religious freedom developed in the ancient church and rediscovered during the Reformation in response to political and religious conflict. Ideas such as freedom of belief, conscience, and an allowance for multiple faiths in single political order were not, it turns out, the result of secular thinkers who turned from violent religious commitments to scientific toleration and peace. Rather these developed in the heart of Christian theology and political experience in Rome and the kingdoms and cities of the sixteenth century.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The reading of each of these has already found their way into my teaching. I think they have offered me ways of communicating more effectively (something we who teach always strive for), and greater understanding of our complex world.

https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			RANSFORM Purposefully.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			You are about to receive your diplomas. You have dreamed about this day for years, and all who surround you have come to celebrate this event with you. You came to this point through much anxiety, but now that you have reach this station, you should check the lenses in which you see the world. Ask yourself: Is my tomorrow filled with fear or faith?
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Fear naturally grabs hold of us, robs us of our sleep, alienates us from friends and family; causes us to strike out against others through words and deeds. Fear lies to us, it distorts our imagination, it creates depression and robs us of any peace and joy that momentarily visits us.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We learn to embrace it, but this force wants to rule our lives. It often becomes the lenses through which we see our future. If we are honest with ourselves, we do not like what we see in the mirror framed by fear. “But God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of love, power and a sound mind.” The Scriptures also tell us that perfect love cast out all fear and that God is love.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We all talk about our goals for the future. We dream of what could be or sometimes what should be. We often pray about our dreams, asking God to assist us in accomplishing our goals. We look to the future often through the lenses of fear but hope faith will find its way into our journey. We expect our dreams fulfilled will give us satisfaction, build confidence and maybe create more faith and courage in our hearts.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			There is nothing wrong in having hope for a prosperous future, but we need to be aware of the source of our dreams. As you look to the possibilities in your future, they will be governed by your fears or your faith. Maybe this next question will help you think about the possibilities: What would you do if you knew you could not fail? Think about it: Since you know that all things are possible with God: what do you really want God to do for you?
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Or maybe the real question should be: What would you do for God if you could not fail? This shifts the focus from how you want God to serve you, to how you want to serve God?
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			During the beginning of Jesus’ ministry many people followed him to hear his words and experience miracles. Just imagine for a moment that you are in a crowd like this, waiting to hear some special truth or see the impossible from the hands of Jesus. You are about to embark on a new life and maybe he has something to say to release you from the doubts and fears that continuously plague you. So you listen carefully.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			He stands before all of you knowing that only a few will catch and keep this truth. Only a few will really hear the word and grab hold of faith enough to receive a miracle, to meet some need or help with a resolve. His words are freedom for those who would hear, releasing us to dream. It matters not your background, or what your initial motives are for following him, it only matters how you receive the words you hear because faith comes by hearing his word.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Now listen closely and hear what Jesus says: “Do not lay-up treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (Matthew 6:19-21).” The real truth is: Your treasure is the seed for your dreams.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Jesus goes on to say: “the eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness!” No one can serve two masters. Either they will be devoted to one or the other. You cannot serve both God and be enslaved to money. One leads to the bondage of fear, the other is the pathway to freedom and faith.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Jesus follows this statement by saying: “Do not be worried about your life, whether you have food or drink or clothing; isn’t life more than these.” God will always provide for those who put their trust in him, but fear tells you he will not.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			So how does he end this challenge? He says: “Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all you need will be provided.” Seek God first and you will face a future of faith: doing things you cannot imagine; impacting lives with light and hope; and inspiring many you have yet to meet.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			A.W. Tozer said it this way: “the man who has God as his treasure has all things in One. … for having the source of all things, he has in One all satisfaction, all pleasure, all delight.” Make God your treasure and in him you will find all that you need for your future.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Let me conclude with a portion of my story. I had overcome many obstacles in completing a bachelor’s degree at a very challenging liberal arts college. I moved on to complete a masters’ degree, later married and became the father of two daughters. I had hope to do a doctorate immediately after the master’s but was discouraged by others in doing so.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As I worked in the field of justice, I realized that a doctorate would provide greater validation for the work I was doing. The longer I waited, the more fearful I became of applying to a program. My fear was of rejection, of not being able to measure up. So, I pushed the dream aside repeatedly. I later grabbed hold of the advice I am giving you today. I began to seek God for what he wanted to accomplish in my life. The lenses in which I viewed the future began to change. Seeking God first shifted my whole perspective. No longer did I view life as what I could accomplish, but I started thinking about what was possible with God. As you have heard us say, “Possible Happens Here at FPU.”
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			During this period of seeking God, I awakened early one morning before dawn. I went outside on the balcony of my bedroom just to be quiet before the Lord. The question came to mind: “Why are you afraid to dream? If the Spirit of God lives in you, then why are you afraid to dream?” I began to realize that the dream seed God had placed in my heart was being choked by the fear of rejection.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			It was at this point I had to decide whether all this was only in my head or whether God was really speaking to me. I turned my face towards the sky and asked the question: What am I afraid of dreaming? It came clear to me that I feared rejection if I applied to a doctoral program. I decided that if this was God, I would apply to the top three programs in the country in my field. Acceptance in one would only be a miracle. I had changed my lenses to see through the eyes of faith. I was rejected by the number two and three programs, but was accepted into the number one program.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Face your future in faith. Seek God with all your heart and you will be surprised where it leads you. You see before you today, the president of Fresno Pacific University, who once only had faith enough to complete a bachelors’ program. But in seeking the Kingdom of God first he found the treasure of faith that extended his dreams far beyond what he could ask or imagine.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Today, you decide about your future; whether it will be governed by faith or fear. Faith will only come through a relationship with God. Jesus says: “I am the way, the truth and the life.” Interesting he says: “the life.” If you really want life, give your life to him and watch how your dreams will soar. He has dreams for you that you can yet imagine. Possible happens in you when you trust in God.

https://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Inspiring conversations in the great outdoors
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			(Photo taken by Andrew Shinn)
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Roughly 90 miles north on Highway 41 you will find yourself emerging from a tunnel to one of the most iconic views in our country. In the foreground on the right side of your frame beautiful Bridalveil Falls tumbles just over 600 feet, emerging from an impossible precipice. The left side is dominated by a guardian of rock respectfully called El Capitan. And in the background, the awe-inspiring outline of Half Dome is visible. The space between these renowned wonders is filled with pines, granite and a peaceful river. The parking area, behind where you are likely standing, is filled with tourists, people who have traveled from all over the world for this opportunity…the opportunity to be inspired by Yosemite Valley. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			And to be sure it is an inspiring space. I have visited this place more times than I can count, and I still find inspiration whenever I come. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Over the fall break I found myself driving through the tunnel once again, feeling particularly inspired. Exiting the tunnel, we were welcomed by a still dark world, the variation of black coming only from the darker shadows outlining the granite monoliths. In a few short moments we began our hike, three faculty/staff members and nine students on a journey to catch sunrise from the top of Yosemite Falls or the summit of Eagle Peak. Another group of staff and students started two hours later from the south rim of the valley to catch the sunrise from Dewey Point.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			It was incredibly cold when we started hiking but the trail is steep and within a few minutes we were shedding layers. The group splintered into small hiking units and I found myself falling into easy, honest conversation with the student in front of me. Slowly we made our way up to the top of Yosemite Falls, spending our time getting to know each other better and offering encouragement to keep going. As we neared the top it was decided that only a small group would continue all the way to the top of Eagle Peak. I said goodbye to my hiking partner, taking with me a poignant reminder of the power of perseverance as I watched this student struggle with doubting her ability to complete the hike as she continued to press forward anyway. When we both arrived back at the bottom we would celebrate her accomplishment and strength. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			A short time later I was standing on the summit of Eagle Peak. Sharing the summit with three students and another faculty member! It was cold but we were rewarded with a 360°-view of Yosemite and an incredible sunrise. (Plus, we fired up stoves for some hot drinks). On our hike down we shared conversation with a few different hiking partners. One talk with a student regarding how to open doors of opportunity for all students to get into the outdoors has stuck with me. I appreciated the honesty and candor of the conversation as he wondered aloud how to remove barriers and stigmas that prevent others from venturing outside. I have mulled over these ideas and thoughts many times since that hike. A few hours later all the hikers met up in Bass Lake to share stories and pictures and lunch after their adventures to watch sunrise. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			This was a fun trip and one to remember. Most importantly, however, it served as an incredible opportunity to connect with students and colleagues. Laughing, feeling frustrated, wondering how much further and standing in awe of the views were all part of the experience. But for me the take-away was the conversations and moments I got to share on the trail with others. On this journey, the inspiration came from the company I kept. I found myself with a renewed energy and excitement to invest in the people, students and colleagues, that I get to teach and learn from on campus. There was something refreshing and necessary about carving space to slow down and be present with my fellow adventurers. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As we find ourselves in the middle of a very busy season—middle of finals, heading to graduation and preparing for the holidays—I think it is a good time for each of us to reflect on the moments of inspiration that kept us going this semester. What are the stories and experiences that make us most excited to come to work at FPU each and every day?

https://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Discovering Hidden Gems
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			In July 2016 Manuela (Manuela Gabriel, Ph.D., ALAS assistant project director) and I arrived in Fresno to work at Fresno Pacific University in the newly created ALAS Title V Program. After living and working in different countries, we landed for the very first time on the West Coast, and honestly, we came without knowing what to expect. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We began working right away with first-generation college students—students whose parents have not earned a four-year degree. At FPU we work with a very diverse and heterogenic group of students that at first sight showed numerous learning difficulties: poor academic skills, financial problems, diverse cultural backgrounds, difficulties integrating into FPU and navigating the higher education system, lack of self-esteem and sometimes lack of family support. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Immediately, we realized this type of student is more common than we thought, particularly in the Central Valley. Statistics show high rates of poverty and social inequality in Fresno, and one of the lowest college graduation rates in the country: nearly 80% of the people who live here don’t have a bachelor’s degree. Nationally, out of the seven million undergraduates attending four-year public and private colleges and universities, about 20% are first-generation students—at FPU 47% are first-generation students. About 50% of all first-generation college students in the U.S. are, and are also more likely to be, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group (Linda Banks-Santilli, 2015). 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Yes, definitely, it is a challenging context, but a place of hope as well. While we encountered students with a variety of complex challenges, we also encountered a group of young undergraduates with great courage, enormous goodwill and strong determination. They are thirsty to learn, confident to overcome obstacles and prepared to make sacrifices. It took us time to realize that they are hidden gems ready to be discovered. Working in the ALAS Intercultural Learning Center gave us the possibility to interact on a daily basis with these students and we have learned to recognize and understand their concerns, fears and limitations. We have also learned to appreciate and value their dreams and their determination to pursue them. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As time goes by, we realized these students understand why they are here. They recognize college provides a pathway to explore themselves and their personal and spiritual interests, expand their social and cultural experiences and build a more promising career. They know higher education can improve career opportunities and gain economic prosperity and social mobility. Our students understand the journey is tough, and they are willing to go through it. There is nothing they want more than to make their families proud, seek a better future, become full members of this society and serve their communities. They are simply asking, sometimes desperately, for an opportunity and for someone who believes in them. These hidden gems are right here around us. Multiple people and resources contribute to the success of those students in the context of FPU, but unfortunately, many of them still fail. Some of the latest changes in the higher education systems are helping, but it is not enough. These gems need a space that is ready to serve them, and we, as a higher education institution, need to show a strong commitment to them. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Three years after arriving in Fresno, we are proud to serve at FPU, and, particularly, in the ALAS program, where a beloved group of people tries hard to support first-generation students in their pursuit of education. ALAS has served 224 undergraduate students in four years, and it has had a tremendous impact in the persistence and retention of those first-generation students by providing academic support; offering career advice; explaining how to navigate the college system; teaching academic, professional and intercultural skills and competences; encouraging diversity and inclusion on campus; and developing a feeling of belonging to FPU through the use of the ALAS Intercultural Learning Center. We are privileged witnesses of many personal and familiar stories of overcoming. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The demographic landscape of California and the Central Valley has changed in the last few decades, and more first-generation students and minorities will be attending Fresno Pacific University in the near future. We need to be prepared to serve the diverse needs of our students, develop their gifts and help them to find their true destiny. These hidden gems deserve a chance to shine.

https://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			The Call to Engage and Serve
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As members of the Fresno Pacific University community, we are called to “Engage the Cultures and Serve the Cities.” This calling is one of the key factors that led to my decision to join Fresno Pacific as an employee in 2018. What good is it to do any job, if the work of that job does not impact and edify others in a meaningful way? I was drawn to Fresno Pacific as a university system that collectively seeks to influence the Central Valley for the glory of the Kingdom. In the last year that I have worked at Fresno Pacific, I have been touched and impressed by the manner in which each department across the university seeks to fulfill this calling through its respective area of responsibility. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The calling to engage and serve is the heart of the mission and vision of the Career Development & Experiential Learning Center (CDELC), where we seek to equip, encourage and empower students and alumni to excel in whatever vocational path they choose. This CDELC mission connects to the broader goals of the university, as we all seek to produce graduates of high ethical values and moral character to enter ministry or the workforce. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	This is a critical and urgent mission; indicators across our local, state and national society at large demonstrate a world that is in need of believers who are salt and light to others. A recent 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	a			article from Christianity Today
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 asserts that Christian colleges are now needed more than ever: “A specifically Christian liberal arts education investigates how the good God is connected with the everyday aspects of life.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the average baby boomer has had at least 12 different jobs during her of his lifetime. Members of Gen X, Millennials and Gen Z are expected to hold an even greater range of job titles and functions across the span of their career. A Christian liberal arts education prepares students not simply for a job, or even for a career, but for vocation—the wisdom that hears God’s call to respond with the whole self to produce meaning and purpose in the world.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Colossians 3:23 states: “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” As I observe Fresno Pacific students transition from education to career, it is evident they embody Colossians 3:23. Fresno Pacific graduates are highly sought after among employers across the Central Valley due to the outstanding ethical standards and moral character they bring to the workplace. Within the Career Development Center, we experience an ongoing, steady stream of partnership requests from employers eager to recruit Fresno Pacific students. A recruitment representative from one of our core employer partners has often stated [paraphrase]: “I’d rather hire two students at Fresno Pacific than 200 from other universities, because I KNOW that FPU students will be the highest quality new hires to bring into our organization. They are honest, dependable and hard working. They hold themselves to a higher standard and that reaps many benefits for our organization.” 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			This employer’s feedback makes my heart sing! It demonstrates that we really are fulfilling the mission and vision of CDELC operations. Through this employer’s partnership with the CDELC, two-three students are hired into internship or employment positions each year. Many of them have had their hard work rewarded with opportunities for promotion and career growth, including one alumnus who started out as an intern and has risen through the ranks and now holds a senior position within the human resources division. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The CDELC does not function or succeed in a silo; we are just one cog in the wheel of the university organization. The career success that each student and member of the alumni achieves is testament to the fact that the CDELC is working in concert with the full Fresno Pacific community in our efforts to make an impact for the Kingdom. As the only faith-based university founded in the Central Valley, Fresno Pacific’s opportunity to impact the local community for the Kingdom is proportionally massive. Our students and alumni carry a tidal wave of ripple effects as they each “Engage the Cultures and Serve the Cities” through their vocational calling.

https://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Collaborating for the Common Good
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Although only the author’s name is on a book’s cover, others are always involved in its creation. That is especially true with my current project. Many significant collaborators are part of the Fresno Pacific University-Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary community.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	The first connection came almost 20 years ago. After reading my first book, Larry Dunn, Ph.D., professor of peacemaking and conflict studies, asked, “Mark, have you read Paul Hiebert’s work on bounded and centered churches?
https://blogs.fresno.edu	a			[1]
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	” I replied, “no,” and Larry told me I should. He was right! I wish I had read Hiebert 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			before
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	 I had published that book, but his work is the foundation of my current project, tentatively titled 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Centered Church: Moving Beyond Judgmentalism and Relativism to New Creation, 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			to be published by InterVarsity Press.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Hiebert, a 1957 seminary graduate, Mennonite Brethren missionary to India and later the leading missionary anthropologist of his generation (and uncle of Fran Martens Friesen, assistant professor of the humanities) borrowed from mathematical set theory to analyze three approaches churches use to identify who belongs to the group. “Bounded set” churches draw lines of judgmental exclusion that wound insiders and outsiders. In reaction some churches have erased the lines and become “fuzzy set” churches, solving some problems and creating others—such as relativism and weak group identity. Hiebert advocates for a “centered set” approach that discerns someone’s status as Christian by looking at their relationship with the center: are they oriented toward or turned away from Jesus? Are they moving toward Jesus? 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	There is more explanation on bounded, fuzzy and centered churches at my 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	a			website,
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 but the focus of this blog is not the content of the book, but the collaborations making the book possible—specifically through FPU connections.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Besides Hiebert, seminary students have made perhaps the most significant contributions. Their questions have led me to tinker with and polish my explanations, and readers will benefit from that refinement. More significantly, student questions convinced me of the need for the book. When students asked questions like: “What is a centered church’s approach to membership?” or “How would a centered church deal with X situation?” I often could not give very good answers and had nothing to point them to. Thanks to them I decided to write the missing resource. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Other collaborations came from focus groups and interviews with over 40 practitioners—many of them former seminary students—during my 2018 sabbatical. I asked questions to learn how they put in practice a centered approach. For example, Scott Carolan graduated from the seminary in 2008 and began serving at The Well, a multi-site community church in the Valley. Not only did he set out to apply the centered paradigm, he passionately told others on staff about it. Talking with Scott and others at The Well provided excellent material for the book. For instance, many assume a church must use a bounded approach in recovery ministry. Therefore, in the book I want a chapter on how to do recovery ministry in a centered way. Where to find an example? Dave Obwald (M.A. in Peacemaking and Conflict Studies) leads the recovery program at The Well. His excellent insights and stories exceeded my expectations.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			My sabbatical research shaped the outline of the book and provided much of the content. Before sending the manuscript to the publisher I wanted to field test it. So, I again searched for collaborators among practitioners.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I invited eight people to not only read and give feedback on the manuscript but to come together for a day and discuss how to improve it. Most had FPU connections, five were current or former seminary students. The pastors came from a variety of churches—from a large multi-site to a small church plant. Some had more experience in bounded churches, others in more fuzzy churches. All have worked at practicing a centered approach. It would be hard to overstate the value of that diversity. For instance, I have limited experience with fuzzy churches, but April Alkema—FPU grad, degree completion instructor and seminary student—and seminary graduate Dustin Maddox, repeatedly suggested ways I could better communicate to people with a fuzzy perspective. This group together yielded more than just the sum of our individual ideas. One comment spurred another, ideas melded and sparked new ideas. Before the meeting, I had a complete manuscript. Now I have a lot more work to do, but it will be a much better book thanks to the input of this group. The finished book will be the fruit of collaboration—mostly with people connected to FPU and FPBS. I am grateful for those connections, and how they improved this book and the education it will provide students and other readers.

https://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Reflections on Italy
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We returned from the FPU Alumni and Friends Tour to Italy in July enriched, a bit tired, sometimes feeling overwhelmed with what we had experienced. Travel changes your perspective, your way of seeing. It challenges us and helps you see and experience things and events in ways we might not have been able to before.  And when you travel to a place like Italy with overlapping historical remains from the ancient, medieval, early modern and modern worlds the experience takes a while to sort out and deepens with time and reflection.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I asked our group of eighteen travelers to offer some of their trip highlights.  Here are their reflections.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Many reflected on how much we had seen.  Some liked the ancient cities of Ostia and Pompeii.  These uncovered ancient cities showed us how Romans lived (they even had toilets that flushed after a fashion).  And, of course, many thought of Rome itself—the Colosseum, the Vatican, the ancient ruins with the modern city all around.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Others recalled “all of Florence.”  And some thought Michelangelo’s work was amazing—the statute of David, the human forms pulling themselves from the marble, and the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Many of us were awed by the first site of the Duomo in Florence, along with Giotto’s campanile or tower, and the baptistry with Ghiberti’s bronze doors. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			A number of us attended a Mass at the Duomo on Sunday morning (and then enjoyed a pastry and drink at a café on the plaza). The interior of the dome, with its painting of the afterlife rising up to the cupola brought a particular view of reality to the experience of coming before God in worship with people from all over the world. This was a highlight for many of us. We often worship wherever we are when traveling. We are always welcomed and refreshed and inspired to be with others in this common experience.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Two cities were noted especially, but for different reasons.  We arrived in Siena the day before the Palio—the twice-yearly horse race between the dozen or so intensely competitive neighborhoods of the city, identified by their animal mascots. Siena was alive with preparations for parties, dinners, celebrations, and awash with people crowding its narrow and twisting streets. The Duomo featured St. Catherine who as a young woman inspired people in Siena and far beyond, and who influenced political and religious leaders, convincing the Pope to return to Rome from under the influence of the French king in Avignon.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	We took a special side trip to Assisi.  For many of us this was a spiritual experience. The art in the cathedral tells the story of the many events of the life of St. Francis.  Every wall is covered with paintings by many different artists. I picked up a little book of scenes painted by the famous artist from the early 14
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 century, about 100 years after Francis, Giotto. The paintings and the story were overwhelming. This was a place to sit and think or pray. Our guide was knowledgeable about the art, and also about the spirituality of Francis.
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We also visited the small town of San Gimignano, with its tall towers, on a hill overlooking Tuscany.  You cannot get much better. A few remembered having some of the best gelato in Italy (and we had a lot of good gelato throughout the trip to compare it to!). The line for the little shop wound its way outside, and across two or three other shops, but it moved quickly, and the wait was worth it. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I asked the question about highlights at the end of our trip, so Venice, where we stopped first was back deeper in our memory. But a few mentioned the canals, St. Mark’s Basilica with its Byzantine dome and tiled mosaics, the brightly colored houses on the island of Burano, and, of course, a ride in a gondola with a soloist to set the mood. 
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Some special moments of the trip were recalled—the cooking class where we learned to make ravioli together (about 15 feet long as I remember it), and the opera dinner in Rome, a “bike ride on the Napoli coast,” our stay on Lido island in Venice, some of the unique shops, a sing-along at a restaurant in Venice, haggling over prices, dinner at the Rialto bridge, for those who stayed on for the extra excursion to Naples the beauty of Capri, and our extraordinary guide, Filomena.  
https://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Many mentioned the good time we had getting to know each other, talking over dinner, long walks as we toured the sites. In a few moments of reflection, we see how travel opens our eyes, minds and hearts.

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Engaging the Cultures and Serving the Cities Through FPU’s Strategic Map
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	At its October Board meeting the Fresno Pacific University Board of Trustees affirmed the Strategic Plan revisions, which are now identified as the FPU Strategic Map 2019-2022. Over the past two years students, staff, faculty and trustees have provided input for clarity in institutional direction. The university’s revised 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	a			vision statement approved in June 2016
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	 and the 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Fresno Pacific Idea
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 are the driving forces that framed the overarching goals of the map. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	 Over this next semester, we will dedicate each 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Connections
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 to highlighting progress, plans and projections on the work toward our five goals. I will introduce the goal during the first week of each month followed by colleagues across campus who will address the objectives. We will hear from members of our community about strategic implementation, proposed innovations and progress toward objectives. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	 Following the acronym GEIST, which identifies the goals, we will introduce each goal with its objectives. During the month of January, we will review 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	ROW Strategically; February –
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	NGAGE Collectively; March – 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	NNOVATE Creatively; April –
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	ERVE Courageously; and May – 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	RANSFORM Purposely. The five goals (GEIST), inspires our community in corporate application and cooperation to strengthen our resolve to actualize the 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Idea
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 We expect contributions and support in each of these areas across the university. Departments and divisions will provide annual action plans which will be assessed at the end of each semester. All work in these areas will be posted on the institutional website. A review of our progress will be reported at the end of each academic year and during the State of the University Report.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	strong			As a reminder, the University Vision Statement approved June 2016 is as follows: 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	Fresno Pacific is a vibrant Christ-centered university that is transforming California’s Central Valley and global communities through exemplary service to students of all ethnicities and cultures. Innovative programs encourage academic and professional excellence, peacemaking, social justice, ethical leadership, holistic wellness and spiritual vitality.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		strong	Goal One: 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	strong			GROW Strategically
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Enlarge the place of your tent, stretch your tent curtains wide, do not hold back, lengthen your cords, strengthen your stakes…Do not be afraid, you will not be put to shame
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 (Isaiah 54:2,4).
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	 We have broadened our borders from Merced to Bakersfield. Now we must steward the ground we have gained. The 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 challenges us to extend the influence of the Kingdom of God through our students. One way to extend that influence throughout the Central Valley is to expand opportunities for high school and community college students to obtain bachelor’s degrees. Our accelerated programs at our regional campuses have grown through those who have left community colleges at some point and decided to pursue a degree later in life.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		br	 Research by the College Futures Foundation reveals that increased four-year degrees are vital to the economic development of the Central Valley. Numerous students who apply to the CSUs and UCs are experiencing increasing difficulty in securing a place at a four-year university. Most recently over 74,000 students who were eligible for the CSUs and UCs could not find a place due to the lack of capacity of the publics to serve. The Futures report is expecting this demand to increase and has identified the Central Valley as one of the two most critical areas. The state and regional communities have identified a critical need where FPU is able to grow capacity and serve. This extended growth will testify to our commitment to engage the cultures and serve the cities in the region.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			  There are four objectives under Goal One:
http://blogs.fresno.edu	li			Increase the overall average student population to 5,000 students per semester, including 1,200 TUG students.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	li	li		Increase scholarship/annual fund revenue through a comprehensive fund development plan which includes greater alumni participation, broader donor-base and grant development.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	li	li		Expand revenue streams that support improvement of academic programs and innovative initiatives.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	li	li		Build and restore facilities that aid recruitment, encourage alumni loyalty and strengthen the university’s image.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	We trust that these 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	 in the coming semester will be informative and keep the FPU community abreast to our corporate progress in meeting each objective. The approved Strategic Map is posted on the 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	a			President’s
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	 page on the intranet. The President’s Cabinet will be inviting members of the community to contribute to this media dialogue over this spring semester. You will also notice that our goals (GEIST) will be posted and viewed electronically on all our campuses. The President’s Office welcomes any stories or anecdotes that may encourage the community as we move forward in living out the

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Popular Histories for Understanding and Teaching
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I have to confess most often I do not like “popular histories.”  I have been trained to read dull, dry, technical works of history in my fields of study, and I find popular histories often misleading, and without the understanding of the mentality, questions, problems, institutions, and limitations of the times they are writing about necessary to write insightful history.  Many of our professions, not just in academia, have similar occupational hazards. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			But I make an effort to read popular histories to gain ideas and insights into how to teach the subjects I have the privilege of discussing each week with students, often in introductory courses.  Popular histories offer models of communication of difficult subjects for non-specialists and provide ways of developing a subject in the classroom.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			This last year I have read a few that I can recommend to my current and former students.  These have the benefit of being by academically trained writers who want to present their subjects accurately and with some depth, but also to communicate with broad audiences. They are sensitive not to politicize their arguments, but also to address their subjects in ways that allow their readers to recognize the complexities of the political world we live in and make judgements about how we should understand and respond when needed.  Here are three about the Middle East that I have read in the last year that I hope some readers of this blog might find interesting.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	The first is on a large topic, Islamic governmental order throughout its history, Hugh Kennedy’s (University of London) 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Caliphate: The History of an Idea 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	(Basic Books, 2016). A “caliph” is the successor of the prophet Mohammed in leading the Muslim community (though not as a prophet) and a deputy of God.  Kennedy focuses on three questions, how a caliph should be chosen, “what should the caliph do and how extensive were his powers to be,” and how these questions were to be decided and on what evidence choices would be made. He develops the variations in answers to each of them, bringing the story up to the 21
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 century and the proclamation of the restoration of the caliphate by ISIS. That story adds great depth to our understanding of a very large and powerful political tradition, and how we might understand the conflicts and claims we see today.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	The second and third each focus on individual cities: Thomas F. Madden of St. Louis University, a historian of the crusades, 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Istanbul: City of Majesty at the Crossroads of the World 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	(Viking, 2016) and Simon Sebag Montefiore, 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Jerusalem: The Biography 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	(Vintage, 2011).  Madden describe “The City” (the meaning of Istanbul) from ancient times, through its centuries as Constantinople the capital of Byzantine civilization and its Ottoman centuries, to the 20
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	 century as the capital of secular, modern Turkey, and the 21
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 as Turkey has returned overtly to Islam under Erdogan. Madden illustrates the power of the city that was feared in Reformation Europe and a source of mystery before and after. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	Montefiore, likewise develops a history of Jerusalem from its ancient centuries as the city of David, Solomon and other Israelite kings, through New Testament times, to Islamic centuries where it was sometimes a religious center, sometimes the place of conflict (the crusades and between competing Muslim political leaders) and when it was a forgotten, dusty, small town in a desert.  He brings the story up to 2010, with it now as a Jewish and Muslim city, a place passionate claims, tension, violence, intense archaeological work, and cherished sites for worship. You can find a presentation of the book and how he wrote it by Montefiore at 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	a			C-Span
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			All of these offer understanding without the technicalities and arguments of academic works.  Each is engagingly written and rewards anytime we spend with them.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	One more written just last year might be added. It too is by an academic historian, written for a popular audience, and focuses on a topic of interest today, Robert Louis Wilken’s (Emeritus, University of Virginia) 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Liberty in the Things of God: The Christian Origins of Religious Freedom
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 (Yale, 2019).  Today when the media narrative is that religion and Christianity is inherently oppressive and violent, Wilken tells the story of how arguments for religious freedom developed in the ancient church and rediscovered during the Reformation in response to political and religious conflict. Ideas such as freedom of belief, conscience, and an allowance for multiple faiths in single political order were not, it turns out, the result of secular thinkers who turned from violent religious commitments to scientific toleration and peace. Rather these developed in the heart of Christian theology and political experience in Rome and the kingdoms and cities of the sixteenth century.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The reading of each of these has already found their way into my teaching. I think they have offered me ways of communicating more effectively (something we who teach always strive for), and greater understanding of our complex world.

http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			RANSFORM Purposefully.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			You are about to receive your diplomas. You have dreamed about this day for years, and all who surround you have come to celebrate this event with you. You came to this point through much anxiety, but now that you have reach this station, you should check the lenses in which you see the world. Ask yourself: Is my tomorrow filled with fear or faith?
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Fear naturally grabs hold of us, robs us of our sleep, alienates us from friends and family; causes us to strike out against others through words and deeds. Fear lies to us, it distorts our imagination, it creates depression and robs us of any peace and joy that momentarily visits us.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We learn to embrace it, but this force wants to rule our lives. It often becomes the lenses through which we see our future. If we are honest with ourselves, we do not like what we see in the mirror framed by fear. “But God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of love, power and a sound mind.” The Scriptures also tell us that perfect love cast out all fear and that God is love.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We all talk about our goals for the future. We dream of what could be or sometimes what should be. We often pray about our dreams, asking God to assist us in accomplishing our goals. We look to the future often through the lenses of fear but hope faith will find its way into our journey. We expect our dreams fulfilled will give us satisfaction, build confidence and maybe create more faith and courage in our hearts.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			There is nothing wrong in having hope for a prosperous future, but we need to be aware of the source of our dreams. As you look to the possibilities in your future, they will be governed by your fears or your faith. Maybe this next question will help you think about the possibilities: What would you do if you knew you could not fail? Think about it: Since you know that all things are possible with God: what do you really want God to do for you?
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Or maybe the real question should be: What would you do for God if you could not fail? This shifts the focus from how you want God to serve you, to how you want to serve God?
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			During the beginning of Jesus’ ministry many people followed him to hear his words and experience miracles. Just imagine for a moment that you are in a crowd like this, waiting to hear some special truth or see the impossible from the hands of Jesus. You are about to embark on a new life and maybe he has something to say to release you from the doubts and fears that continuously plague you. So you listen carefully.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			He stands before all of you knowing that only a few will catch and keep this truth. Only a few will really hear the word and grab hold of faith enough to receive a miracle, to meet some need or help with a resolve. His words are freedom for those who would hear, releasing us to dream. It matters not your background, or what your initial motives are for following him, it only matters how you receive the words you hear because faith comes by hearing his word.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Now listen closely and hear what Jesus says: “Do not lay-up treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also (Matthew 6:19-21).” The real truth is: Your treasure is the seed for your dreams.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Jesus goes on to say: “the eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness!” No one can serve two masters. Either they will be devoted to one or the other. You cannot serve both God and be enslaved to money. One leads to the bondage of fear, the other is the pathway to freedom and faith.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Jesus follows this statement by saying: “Do not be worried about your life, whether you have food or drink or clothing; isn’t life more than these.” God will always provide for those who put their trust in him, but fear tells you he will not.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			So how does he end this challenge? He says: “Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all you need will be provided.” Seek God first and you will face a future of faith: doing things you cannot imagine; impacting lives with light and hope; and inspiring many you have yet to meet.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			A.W. Tozer said it this way: “the man who has God as his treasure has all things in One. … for having the source of all things, he has in One all satisfaction, all pleasure, all delight.” Make God your treasure and in him you will find all that you need for your future.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Let me conclude with a portion of my story. I had overcome many obstacles in completing a bachelor’s degree at a very challenging liberal arts college. I moved on to complete a masters’ degree, later married and became the father of two daughters. I had hope to do a doctorate immediately after the master’s but was discouraged by others in doing so.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As I worked in the field of justice, I realized that a doctorate would provide greater validation for the work I was doing. The longer I waited, the more fearful I became of applying to a program. My fear was of rejection, of not being able to measure up. So, I pushed the dream aside repeatedly. I later grabbed hold of the advice I am giving you today. I began to seek God for what he wanted to accomplish in my life. The lenses in which I viewed the future began to change. Seeking God first shifted my whole perspective. No longer did I view life as what I could accomplish, but I started thinking about what was possible with God. As you have heard us say, “Possible Happens Here at FPU.”
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			During this period of seeking God, I awakened early one morning before dawn. I went outside on the balcony of my bedroom just to be quiet before the Lord. The question came to mind: “Why are you afraid to dream? If the Spirit of God lives in you, then why are you afraid to dream?” I began to realize that the dream seed God had placed in my heart was being choked by the fear of rejection.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			It was at this point I had to decide whether all this was only in my head or whether God was really speaking to me. I turned my face towards the sky and asked the question: What am I afraid of dreaming? It came clear to me that I feared rejection if I applied to a doctoral program. I decided that if this was God, I would apply to the top three programs in the country in my field. Acceptance in one would only be a miracle. I had changed my lenses to see through the eyes of faith. I was rejected by the number two and three programs, but was accepted into the number one program.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Face your future in faith. Seek God with all your heart and you will be surprised where it leads you. You see before you today, the president of Fresno Pacific University, who once only had faith enough to complete a bachelors’ program. But in seeking the Kingdom of God first he found the treasure of faith that extended his dreams far beyond what he could ask or imagine.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Today, you decide about your future; whether it will be governed by faith or fear. Faith will only come through a relationship with God. Jesus says: “I am the way, the truth and the life.” Interesting he says: “the life.” If you really want life, give your life to him and watch how your dreams will soar. He has dreams for you that you can yet imagine. Possible happens in you when you trust in God.

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Inspiring conversations in the great outdoors
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			(Photo taken by Andrew Shinn)
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Roughly 90 miles north on Highway 41 you will find yourself emerging from a tunnel to one of the most iconic views in our country. In the foreground on the right side of your frame beautiful Bridalveil Falls tumbles just over 600 feet, emerging from an impossible precipice. The left side is dominated by a guardian of rock respectfully called El Capitan. And in the background, the awe-inspiring outline of Half Dome is visible. The space between these renowned wonders is filled with pines, granite and a peaceful river. The parking area, behind where you are likely standing, is filled with tourists, people who have traveled from all over the world for this opportunity…the opportunity to be inspired by Yosemite Valley. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			And to be sure it is an inspiring space. I have visited this place more times than I can count, and I still find inspiration whenever I come. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Over the fall break I found myself driving through the tunnel once again, feeling particularly inspired. Exiting the tunnel, we were welcomed by a still dark world, the variation of black coming only from the darker shadows outlining the granite monoliths. In a few short moments we began our hike, three faculty/staff members and nine students on a journey to catch sunrise from the top of Yosemite Falls or the summit of Eagle Peak. Another group of staff and students started two hours later from the south rim of the valley to catch the sunrise from Dewey Point.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			It was incredibly cold when we started hiking but the trail is steep and within a few minutes we were shedding layers. The group splintered into small hiking units and I found myself falling into easy, honest conversation with the student in front of me. Slowly we made our way up to the top of Yosemite Falls, spending our time getting to know each other better and offering encouragement to keep going. As we neared the top it was decided that only a small group would continue all the way to the top of Eagle Peak. I said goodbye to my hiking partner, taking with me a poignant reminder of the power of perseverance as I watched this student struggle with doubting her ability to complete the hike as she continued to press forward anyway. When we both arrived back at the bottom we would celebrate her accomplishment and strength. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			A short time later I was standing on the summit of Eagle Peak. Sharing the summit with three students and another faculty member! It was cold but we were rewarded with a 360°-view of Yosemite and an incredible sunrise. (Plus, we fired up stoves for some hot drinks). On our hike down we shared conversation with a few different hiking partners. One talk with a student regarding how to open doors of opportunity for all students to get into the outdoors has stuck with me. I appreciated the honesty and candor of the conversation as he wondered aloud how to remove barriers and stigmas that prevent others from venturing outside. I have mulled over these ideas and thoughts many times since that hike. A few hours later all the hikers met up in Bass Lake to share stories and pictures and lunch after their adventures to watch sunrise. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			This was a fun trip and one to remember. Most importantly, however, it served as an incredible opportunity to connect with students and colleagues. Laughing, feeling frustrated, wondering how much further and standing in awe of the views were all part of the experience. But for me the take-away was the conversations and moments I got to share on the trail with others. On this journey, the inspiration came from the company I kept. I found myself with a renewed energy and excitement to invest in the people, students and colleagues, that I get to teach and learn from on campus. There was something refreshing and necessary about carving space to slow down and be present with my fellow adventurers. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As we find ourselves in the middle of a very busy season—middle of finals, heading to graduation and preparing for the holidays—I think it is a good time for each of us to reflect on the moments of inspiration that kept us going this semester. What are the stories and experiences that make us most excited to come to work at FPU each and every day?

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Discovering Hidden Gems
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			In July 2016 Manuela (Manuela Gabriel, Ph.D., ALAS assistant project director) and I arrived in Fresno to work at Fresno Pacific University in the newly created ALAS Title V Program. After living and working in different countries, we landed for the very first time on the West Coast, and honestly, we came without knowing what to expect. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We began working right away with first-generation college students—students whose parents have not earned a four-year degree. At FPU we work with a very diverse and heterogenic group of students that at first sight showed numerous learning difficulties: poor academic skills, financial problems, diverse cultural backgrounds, difficulties integrating into FPU and navigating the higher education system, lack of self-esteem and sometimes lack of family support. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Immediately, we realized this type of student is more common than we thought, particularly in the Central Valley. Statistics show high rates of poverty and social inequality in Fresno, and one of the lowest college graduation rates in the country: nearly 80% of the people who live here don’t have a bachelor’s degree. Nationally, out of the seven million undergraduates attending four-year public and private colleges and universities, about 20% are first-generation students—at FPU 47% are first-generation students. About 50% of all first-generation college students in the U.S. are, and are also more likely to be, a member of a racial or ethnic minority group (Linda Banks-Santilli, 2015). 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Yes, definitely, it is a challenging context, but a place of hope as well. While we encountered students with a variety of complex challenges, we also encountered a group of young undergraduates with great courage, enormous goodwill and strong determination. They are thirsty to learn, confident to overcome obstacles and prepared to make sacrifices. It took us time to realize that they are hidden gems ready to be discovered. Working in the ALAS Intercultural Learning Center gave us the possibility to interact on a daily basis with these students and we have learned to recognize and understand their concerns, fears and limitations. We have also learned to appreciate and value their dreams and their determination to pursue them. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As time goes by, we realized these students understand why they are here. They recognize college provides a pathway to explore themselves and their personal and spiritual interests, expand their social and cultural experiences and build a more promising career. They know higher education can improve career opportunities and gain economic prosperity and social mobility. Our students understand the journey is tough, and they are willing to go through it. There is nothing they want more than to make their families proud, seek a better future, become full members of this society and serve their communities. They are simply asking, sometimes desperately, for an opportunity and for someone who believes in them. These hidden gems are right here around us. Multiple people and resources contribute to the success of those students in the context of FPU, but unfortunately, many of them still fail. Some of the latest changes in the higher education systems are helping, but it is not enough. These gems need a space that is ready to serve them, and we, as a higher education institution, need to show a strong commitment to them. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Three years after arriving in Fresno, we are proud to serve at FPU, and, particularly, in the ALAS program, where a beloved group of people tries hard to support first-generation students in their pursuit of education. ALAS has served 224 undergraduate students in four years, and it has had a tremendous impact in the persistence and retention of those first-generation students by providing academic support; offering career advice; explaining how to navigate the college system; teaching academic, professional and intercultural skills and competences; encouraging diversity and inclusion on campus; and developing a feeling of belonging to FPU through the use of the ALAS Intercultural Learning Center. We are privileged witnesses of many personal and familiar stories of overcoming. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The demographic landscape of California and the Central Valley has changed in the last few decades, and more first-generation students and minorities will be attending Fresno Pacific University in the near future. We need to be prepared to serve the diverse needs of our students, develop their gifts and help them to find their true destiny. These hidden gems deserve a chance to shine.

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			The Call to Engage and Serve
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			As members of the Fresno Pacific University community, we are called to “Engage the Cultures and Serve the Cities.” This calling is one of the key factors that led to my decision to join Fresno Pacific as an employee in 2018. What good is it to do any job, if the work of that job does not impact and edify others in a meaningful way? I was drawn to Fresno Pacific as a university system that collectively seeks to influence the Central Valley for the glory of the Kingdom. In the last year that I have worked at Fresno Pacific, I have been touched and impressed by the manner in which each department across the university seeks to fulfill this calling through its respective area of responsibility. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The calling to engage and serve is the heart of the mission and vision of the Career Development & Experiential Learning Center (CDELC), where we seek to equip, encourage and empower students and alumni to excel in whatever vocational path they choose. This CDELC mission connects to the broader goals of the university, as we all seek to produce graduates of high ethical values and moral character to enter ministry or the workforce. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	This is a critical and urgent mission; indicators across our local, state and national society at large demonstrate a world that is in need of believers who are salt and light to others. A recent 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	a			article from Christianity Today
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 asserts that Christian colleges are now needed more than ever: “A specifically Christian liberal arts education investigates how the good God is connected with the everyday aspects of life.” The Bureau of Labor Statistics notes that the average baby boomer has had at least 12 different jobs during her of his lifetime. Members of Gen X, Millennials and Gen Z are expected to hold an even greater range of job titles and functions across the span of their career. A Christian liberal arts education prepares students not simply for a job, or even for a career, but for vocation—the wisdom that hears God’s call to respond with the whole self to produce meaning and purpose in the world.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Colossians 3:23 states: “Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.” As I observe Fresno Pacific students transition from education to career, it is evident they embody Colossians 3:23. Fresno Pacific graduates are highly sought after among employers across the Central Valley due to the outstanding ethical standards and moral character they bring to the workplace. Within the Career Development Center, we experience an ongoing, steady stream of partnership requests from employers eager to recruit Fresno Pacific students. A recruitment representative from one of our core employer partners has often stated [paraphrase]: “I’d rather hire two students at Fresno Pacific than 200 from other universities, because I KNOW that FPU students will be the highest quality new hires to bring into our organization. They are honest, dependable and hard working. They hold themselves to a higher standard and that reaps many benefits for our organization.” 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			This employer’s feedback makes my heart sing! It demonstrates that we really are fulfilling the mission and vision of CDELC operations. Through this employer’s partnership with the CDELC, two-three students are hired into internship or employment positions each year. Many of them have had their hard work rewarded with opportunities for promotion and career growth, including one alumnus who started out as an intern and has risen through the ranks and now holds a senior position within the human resources division. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			The CDELC does not function or succeed in a silo; we are just one cog in the wheel of the university organization. The career success that each student and member of the alumni achieves is testament to the fact that the CDELC is working in concert with the full Fresno Pacific community in our efforts to make an impact for the Kingdom. As the only faith-based university founded in the Central Valley, Fresno Pacific’s opportunity to impact the local community for the Kingdom is proportionally massive. Our students and alumni carry a tidal wave of ripple effects as they each “Engage the Cultures and Serve the Cities” through their vocational calling.

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Collaborating for the Common Good
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Although only the author’s name is on a book’s cover, others are always involved in its creation. That is especially true with my current project. Many significant collaborators are part of the Fresno Pacific University-Fresno Pacific Biblical Seminary community.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	The first connection came almost 20 years ago. After reading my first book, Larry Dunn, Ph.D., professor of peacemaking and conflict studies, asked, “Mark, have you read Paul Hiebert’s work on bounded and centered churches?
http://blogs.fresno.edu	a			[1]
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	” I replied, “no,” and Larry told me I should. He was right! I wish I had read Hiebert 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			before
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		em	 I had published that book, but his work is the foundation of my current project, tentatively titled 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	em			Centered Church: Moving Beyond Judgmentalism and Relativism to New Creation, 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			to be published by InterVarsity Press.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Hiebert, a 1957 seminary graduate, Mennonite Brethren missionary to India and later the leading missionary anthropologist of his generation (and uncle of Fran Martens Friesen, assistant professor of the humanities) borrowed from mathematical set theory to analyze three approaches churches use to identify who belongs to the group. “Bounded set” churches draw lines of judgmental exclusion that wound insiders and outsiders. In reaction some churches have erased the lines and become “fuzzy set” churches, solving some problems and creating others—such as relativism and weak group identity. Hiebert advocates for a “centered set” approach that discerns someone’s status as Christian by looking at their relationship with the center: are they oriented toward or turned away from Jesus? Are they moving toward Jesus? 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		a	There is more explanation on bounded, fuzzy and centered churches at my 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	a			website,
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 but the focus of this blog is not the content of the book, but the collaborations making the book possible—specifically through FPU connections.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Besides Hiebert, seminary students have made perhaps the most significant contributions. Their questions have led me to tinker with and polish my explanations, and readers will benefit from that refinement. More significantly, student questions convinced me of the need for the book. When students asked questions like: “What is a centered church’s approach to membership?” or “How would a centered church deal with X situation?” I often could not give very good answers and had nothing to point them to. Thanks to them I decided to write the missing resource. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Other collaborations came from focus groups and interviews with over 40 practitioners—many of them former seminary students—during my 2018 sabbatical. I asked questions to learn how they put in practice a centered approach. For example, Scott Carolan graduated from the seminary in 2008 and began serving at The Well, a multi-site community church in the Valley. Not only did he set out to apply the centered paradigm, he passionately told others on staff about it. Talking with Scott and others at The Well provided excellent material for the book. For instance, many assume a church must use a bounded approach in recovery ministry. Therefore, in the book I want a chapter on how to do recovery ministry in a centered way. Where to find an example? Dave Obwald (M.A. in Peacemaking and Conflict Studies) leads the recovery program at The Well. His excellent insights and stories exceeded my expectations.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			My sabbatical research shaped the outline of the book and provided much of the content. Before sending the manuscript to the publisher I wanted to field test it. So, I again searched for collaborators among practitioners.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I invited eight people to not only read and give feedback on the manuscript but to come together for a day and discuss how to improve it. Most had FPU connections, five were current or former seminary students. The pastors came from a variety of churches—from a large multi-site to a small church plant. Some had more experience in bounded churches, others in more fuzzy churches. All have worked at practicing a centered approach. It would be hard to overstate the value of that diversity. For instance, I have limited experience with fuzzy churches, but April Alkema—FPU grad, degree completion instructor and seminary student—and seminary graduate Dustin Maddox, repeatedly suggested ways I could better communicate to people with a fuzzy perspective. This group together yielded more than just the sum of our individual ideas. One comment spurred another, ideas melded and sparked new ideas. Before the meeting, I had a complete manuscript. Now I have a lot more work to do, but it will be a much better book thanks to the input of this group. The finished book will be the fruit of collaboration—mostly with people connected to FPU and FPBS. I am grateful for those connections, and how they improved this book and the education it will provide students and other readers.

http://blogs.fresno.edu	h2			Reflections on Italy
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We returned from the FPU Alumni and Friends Tour to Italy in July enriched, a bit tired, sometimes feeling overwhelmed with what we had experienced. Travel changes your perspective, your way of seeing. It challenges us and helps you see and experience things and events in ways we might not have been able to before.  And when you travel to a place like Italy with overlapping historical remains from the ancient, medieval, early modern and modern worlds the experience takes a while to sort out and deepens with time and reflection.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I asked our group of eighteen travelers to offer some of their trip highlights.  Here are their reflections.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Many reflected on how much we had seen.  Some liked the ancient cities of Ostia and Pompeii.  These uncovered ancient cities showed us how Romans lived (they even had toilets that flushed after a fashion).  And, of course, many thought of Rome itself—the Colosseum, the Vatican, the ancient ruins with the modern city all around.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Others recalled “all of Florence.”  And some thought Michelangelo’s work was amazing—the statute of David, the human forms pulling themselves from the marble, and the Sistine Chapel at the Vatican.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Many of us were awed by the first site of the Duomo in Florence, along with Giotto’s campanile or tower, and the baptistry with Ghiberti’s bronze doors. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			A number of us attended a Mass at the Duomo on Sunday morning (and then enjoyed a pastry and drink at a café on the plaza). The interior of the dome, with its painting of the afterlife rising up to the cupola brought a particular view of reality to the experience of coming before God in worship with people from all over the world. This was a highlight for many of us. We often worship wherever we are when traveling. We are always welcomed and refreshed and inspired to be with others in this common experience.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Two cities were noted especially, but for different reasons.  We arrived in Siena the day before the Palio—the twice-yearly horse race between the dozen or so intensely competitive neighborhoods of the city, identified by their animal mascots. Siena was alive with preparations for parties, dinners, celebrations, and awash with people crowding its narrow and twisting streets. The Duomo featured St. Catherine who as a young woman inspired people in Siena and far beyond, and who influenced political and religious leaders, convincing the Pope to return to Rome from under the influence of the French king in Avignon.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p		sup	We took a special side trip to Assisi.  For many of us this was a spiritual experience. The art in the cathedral tells the story of the many events of the life of St. Francis.  Every wall is covered with paintings by many different artists. I picked up a little book of scenes painted by the famous artist from the early 14
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			 century, about 100 years after Francis, Giotto. The paintings and the story were overwhelming. This was a place to sit and think or pray. Our guide was knowledgeable about the art, and also about the spirituality of Francis.
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			We also visited the small town of San Gimignano, with its tall towers, on a hill overlooking Tuscany.  You cannot get much better. A few remembered having some of the best gelato in Italy (and we had a lot of good gelato throughout the trip to compare it to!). The line for the little shop wound its way outside, and across two or three other shops, but it moved quickly, and the wait was worth it. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			I asked the question about highlights at the end of our trip, so Venice, where we stopped first was back deeper in our memory. But a few mentioned the canals, St. Mark’s Basilica with its Byzantine dome and tiled mosaics, the brightly colored houses on the island of Burano, and, of course, a ride in a gondola with a soloist to set the mood. 
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Some special moments of the trip were recalled—the cooking class where we learned to make ravioli together (about 15 feet long as I remember it), and the opera dinner in Rome, a “bike ride on the Napoli coast,” our stay on Lido island in Venice, some of the unique shops, a sing-along at a restaurant in Venice, haggling over prices, dinner at the Rialto bridge, for those who stayed on for the extra excursion to Naples the beauty of Capri, and our extraordinary guide, Filomena.  
http://blogs.fresno.edu	p			Many mentioned the good time we had getting to know each other, talking over dinner, long walks as we toured the sites. In a few moments of reflection, we see how travel opens our eyes, minds and hearts.
