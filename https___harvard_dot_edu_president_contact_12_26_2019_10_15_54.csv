https://harvard.edu/president/contact	h3			President’s student office hours
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	p			President Bacow will hold office hours for students on:
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	div			October 23, 2019, 3:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m.
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	div			February 12, 2020, 3:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. 
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	div			April 14, 2020, 3:00 p.m. – 4:00 p.m.
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	p			Sign-up for office hours will take place from 2:30 p.m. – 4:00 p.m. in the Massachusetts Hall reception area on the day before the scheduled office hours. Any students attending the office hours must have a valid and current Harvard University student ID and are welcome on a first-come, first-served basis.
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	p			President Bacow’s office hours give both students and the president an opportunity to meet and discuss a wide variety of subjects affecting them and the University. These sessions are not intended as an opportunity for student groups to request endorsement letters or funding. Students with such projects in mind should consider approaching the dean of students for their particular School instead.
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	p		a	In Harvard College, the Common Grant Application, devised with the Undergraduate Council, offers 10 sources of on-campus funding for student organizations. Students in the College can access the 
https://harvard.edu/president/contact	a			Common Grant Application
