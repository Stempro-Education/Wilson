https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	h1			Welcome
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	strong			Welcome to the University of Massachusetts Amherst!
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p			  Fueled by a revolutionary spirit that drives excellence and innovation, UMass Amherst continues to achieve success at every level.
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p		em	  Moving up again in the 2020 
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	em			U.S. News and World Report Guide to Colleges
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p			, we are now No. 24 among 146 public institutions in the survey. Having climbed from No. 52 in 2010, we’re one of the fastest rising top-tier public research universities in the country.
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p			  Our success is reflected throughout the campus. We are the destination of choice for the highest academically achieving students from across the commonwealth and around the world. Students choose from over 100 bachelor's degree programs, five associate degree, more than 75 master’s and 48 doctoral programs. Co-curricular and experiential opportunities include undergraduate research programs; career-related internships; mentors for our emerging entrepreneurs; engagement in the community through service learning; and hundreds of student organizations.
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p			  Our national and international reputation for research continues growing, as our faculty lead the way with a commitment to bold, pioneering discovery and creativity across disciplines. In Fiscal Year 2019, we received more than 1,100 sponsored research awards, totaling over $195 million, an increase of 21 percent from last year and a new all-time high for the campus, while over the past ten years, our total research grant funding has increased 42 percent.
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p			  A wave of new and renovated campus facilities provides our faculty and students access to a cutting-edge living and learning environment, while our commitment to ensuring all new construction is 100 percent LEED-certified demonstrates our role as a national leader in sustainability.
https://www.umass.edu/chancellor	p			  As we welcome academically accomplished, socially responsible students who seek a research-rich, inclusive learning community, I am proud to lead the flagship campus of the commonwealth during one of the most exciting times in our history.
