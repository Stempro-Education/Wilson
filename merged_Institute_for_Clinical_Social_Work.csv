https://50.iupui.edu/history/index.html	h2			50 years (and many more)
https://50.iupui.edu/history/index.html	p	h2	br	Like all good things, IUPUI didn’t happen overnight. Its history goes back at least seven decades earlier to 1891, when Indiana University offered classes in Indianapolis for the very first time.
https://50.iupui.edu/history/index.html	p	h2	br	In the decades that followed, both IU and Purdue brought programs to Indianapolis in the liberal arts, sciences, and medicine; however, they operated on their own terms until 1968, when the mayor at that time, Richard Lugar, called for a “great state university in Indianapolis.”
https://50.iupui.edu/history/index.html	p	h2		Our story begins the following year, in 1969.

The college was based on the principles of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn and was associated with the Turnverein. It moved to Indianapolis from Milwaukee in 1907 and was located in The German House (Das Deutsche Haus). Students at the college took classes not only in physical exercise but also in the sciences (such as anatomy and physics), humanities (history and literature), and fine arts (singing and dancing). In 1941 the Normal College became affiliated with Indiana University. Renamed the Indiana University School of Physical Education in 1973, it is the oldest continuously operating school of physical education in the country.

The boxes contained IBM cards, one card per student in the class. Once all the cards were gone from the box, the class was full.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			"Synopsis: People who are incarcerated or experiencing psychosis have generally received ""treatment"" that primarily involves medicating and institutionalizing this feared “other.” At times, the mental health profession has been complicit in denying equal access to long-term, in-depth treatment. Presenters Elizabeth Kita, PhD, and Johanna Dobrich, LCSW-R will illustrate how psychodynamic treatment with marginalized, institutionalized, and criminalized individuals requires therapists to bear the unbearable, to tolerate our dread and “allow ourselves to feel in our own bones what the client feels but often cannot say (Berzoff, 2012)."

http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			Clinical work with formerly incarcerated people who have served life-sentences
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		Discussant: Huey Hawkins, LCSW
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p	em	Synopsis: People who commit horrifying and irreparable acts such as murder are often assumed to not want to know what they have done; psychoanalysis suggests that perhaps they do not know 
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			how
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		 to know what they have done. In this paper, I discuss my clinical work with people who, sentenced to life after being convicted of murder, spent decades in prison and have now returned home to the community challenged to live life after serving life. I will explore the ways in which “lifers”, and the clinicians with whom they work, are confronted by unbearable truths related to the violence of both crime and punishment, the vital role of reparative capacity in resuming the growth that such traumas halt, and the hope that suffering can be transformed not just reenacted.
http://www.icsw.edu/events	strong			Elizabeth (Beth) Kita, PhD
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p			 is a clinical social worker in public/private practice in San Francisco, California. In her private practice, she works primarily with people contending with the effects of complex posttraumatic stress and vicarious traumatization; her work in a public clinic is with people who are returning to the community following lengthy periods of incarceration. She obtained her MSW from UC Berkeley and her PhD from Smith College, School for Social Work. In addition to her clinical work, Beth teaches in the MSW program at UC Berkeley, and is the Co-Chair of the Coalition for Clinical Social Work. She thinks, writes, presents and consults on the intersections of race/racism, trauma, violence, incarceration and psychodynamic social work praxis in the United States.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			Standing in the Twilight: A Relational Perspective on Working With(in) Psychotic States of Mind
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		Discussant: Santiago Delboy, LCSW, MBA
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p	em	Synopsis: This paper explores the treatment of patients who present with imprisoned states of mind that do not easily lend themselves to a psychoanalytic process. A brief review of the uneasy relationship between psychoanalysis and psychotic/borderline states of mind will be provided, followed by a clinical case presentation in which an analyst works with a woman bound to a delusional world. If the capacity to mentalize is at the heart of reflective functioning and relationality, how does one facilitate this development when psychotic features dominate the landscape? Adopting a relational psychoanalytic approach, the clinical encounter will demonstrate how reflective use of the analyst’s ‘selves’ 
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			may
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p	em	 potentiate the capacity for symbolization within the dyad. It will be argued that the capacity to symbolize is a necessary precursor to the development of a subjectively 
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			felt
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		 sense of self and, that all individuals, no matter where they land on the neurotic-borderline-psychotic spectrum, are deserving of a treatment modality in which meaning- making and self-development are provided.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		In his paper, Dr. Reis will attempt to broaden the conception of witnessing in analytic work with traumatized patients by extending the idea to incorporate the patient’s developing and varied capacity for witnessing, as well as a witnessing that occurs within the analytic relationship itself. Actions occurring as part of traumatic repetition are understood to represent memory phenomena and are distinguished from dissociated self-state experience. These experiences are not therapeutically intended to be symbolized, but rather lived-through with the analyst, thus transforming the patient’s own relation to the experience. I suggest that the scene in which this living-through takes place is the transference–countertransference matrix, and that it is the analytic encounter that allows traumatic repetition to take on the quality of a communication, an address to another, rather than remain meaningless reproduction. A clinical vignette illustrates the turning of trauma’s imperative for  witnessing into an address in the analytic encounter.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	strong			Traditionally, presenting symptoms, such as used in DSM categories, have been used to classify personality disorders. The psychoanalytic perspective has provided an understanding of the unconscious psychodynamics that underlies these symptoms. In this conference, the presenters will enlarge on both these approaches by exploring the neuropsychological processes that underly these disorders. Two case presentations and clinical discussions will be used to illustrate how these different approaches may be integrated and ordered to deepen psychotherapists’ understanding of these disorders.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	h2	h1		The Wisdom of Psychodynamic Theory: What Does it Offer Us In Our Multicultural World?
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			Conversations Among Psychodynamic Clinicians
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p			Since Freud, and across professional and academic disciplines, psychodynamic thinking has been idealized, debated, and at times denigrated as a form of therapeutic practice.   And yet, the meaningfulness and utility of psychodynamic theorizing persists, finding sustained life within ordinary contemporary psychotherapeutic practice.  This series, using discrete sets of psychodynamic theory in combination with personal and clinical associations by small panels of ICSW faculty and doctoral students, will explore how and why these discourses matter in the context of our diverse social world.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		Relational Theory was a term coined to capture various threads of post-Freudian theory development (Ferenzi, Fairbairn, Klein, Winnicott and Kohut) that moved away from the concept of drives as the bedrock of psychic life.  
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		Fueled by the post-modern up-ending of scientific “objectivity” and the explosion of infant developmental research - Relational Theory has a contemporary focus on subjectivity, social attachment, multiplicity and mutuality in the clinical process: providing a distinctive prism to reflect upon facets of multiculturalism, race, gender, sexuality, class and intergenerational processes.

Clinically, his thinking continues to be debated and critiqued, while also finding sustained life within ordinary psychotherapeutic practice.  This panel of senior faculty of the Institute for Clinical Social Work will present snapshots of their own thinking on the question of Freud’s clinical relevance today, especially in the context of our diverse world, and our growing sensitivity to race, class, gender, sexualities, and all forms of social location.   There will be ample time for conversation with the audience.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	strong			A Preconference Performance
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		 by Her Story Theater will take place on Friday evening, April 26. (Conference Registration is required).
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			Synopsis
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	h2		Human understanding, upon which clinical practice is based, is rooted in compassion derived from contact with experiences outside our own. One irony about this comes with the realization that we are more alike than the differences which have been made of us. ICSW’s full day conference will focus on experiences of women who are living —often— off our symbolic professional register, whose lives are beyond the reach of our formal theories and practices. We will hear from (and about) women —both globally and locally— who have suffered violence and injustice. In coming together we can expand the domain of our understanding and learn something about ourselves, as clinicians and as citizens.  
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			Educational Objectives
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p	br	1) Attendees will learn about the physical and psychological impact of the global and local scope of human rights violations against women.
http://www.icsw.edu/events	p	p		2)  Attendees will learn the unique clinical needs and medical outcomes of women who have suffered gender-based violence, oppression, and discrimination.

http://www.icsw.edu/events	strong			KEYNOTE PRESENTATION
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			Female Genital Mutilation:  Human Rights Versus Cultural Rites. The practice of female genital cutting has been followed by many different cultures and societies across the ages and continents. It is an ancient, culturally sanctioned trauma involving the removal of parts or all of the external female genitalia. Approximately 200
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			million women have undergone FGM/C worldwide, while in Africa a further 3 million girls are at risk of the practice this year. As a result of migration, cases of this practice have been documented in
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			the United States where 500,000 women, between the ages of 15 and 49, are estimated to have been cut or are at risk of being cut.  Trauma imprints from this injurious tradition may include lifelong health
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			complications. In addition to medical consequences, many girls and young
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			women suffer serious psychological distress, sexual difficulties and social
http://www.icsw.edu/events	em			stigmatisms from the effects of FGM/C. This presentation will discuss the significant psycho-neurological and psycho-sexual impacts, as well as explore the historical transmission and subsequent intergenerational trauma of FGM/C. Clinical examples will be included in the presentation.
