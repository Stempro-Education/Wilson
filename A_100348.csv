http://www.clarksoncollege.edu	p			Clarkson College has not always been a college. Instead, we began in 1888 as a school of nursing—the first in the state of Nebraska. Over the last 125 years, we've established a new campus, expanded our program offerings and adopted a new name. All the while, we've maintained a commitment to preparing our students to be the best in various realms of health care. This commitment to excellence has and always will remain a defining quality of Clarkson College.
