https://thomasmorecollege.edu/oxford-program-2019	h2			Oxford Program 2019
https://thomasmorecollege.edu/oxford-program-2019	p			Thomas More College’s Oxford Studies Program is a two-week course that delves into the lives and thoughts of G.K. Chesterton and other major Catholic thinkers such as John Henry Cardinal Newman, poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, and authors Hilaire Belloc and  J.R.R. Tolkien. The program is designed to prepare participants for graduate school while helping them gain a deeper understanding of the role of the Catholic intellectual in today’s world through a combination of seminar-style lectures, guided tours, discussions, and conversations inspired by these four great writers.
https://thomasmorecollege.edu/oxford-program-2019	h2			Explore landmarks of England that are important to great thinkers and English history.
https://thomasmorecollege.edu/oxford-program-2019	p			Students explore landmarks of England that are important to these thinkers and English history. Students see Cardinal Newman’s colleges, the church where he preached as an Anglican, and the retreat center in Littlemore where he was received into the Catholic church in 1845. Furthermore, participants visit Tolkien’s grave in Wolvercote, one of his houses, and the pub where he and other Inklings met. In addition, they tour The Kilns, the home of C.S. Lewis, where he and Tolkien would frequently meet.

http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	h1			The Joy of Rome
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	h1		Today began a new week, Week Two, in beautiful Roma. We are heading in with our Rome Vows, which means that despite writing this at 23:00 (and probably going for a snack after), I will be getting up at 6:00 to head to daily Mass at St. Peters. Undoubtedly the best part of the New Villa is its distance from the Vatican. It takes exactly 8 minutes to walk from your bed, across the cobblestone, through security, and inside the great doors of the Basilica. Almost every morning that I have been in Rome, I and a few others have slipped into the pews of the altar where Pope Saint John XXIII’s body lays, uncorrupted. I still have not decided if it is seeing the sun rise through the arms of the Church, or the crisp Rome air, which makes my eyes water.  But, Owen and I agree that the pain of waking up early almost disappears on that early walk to Saint Peters.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	p		A few days ago in class, Dr. Connell introduced us to the beloved phrase, ‘Semper Incipe’, or “Always Begin”. One of Rome’s gifts to us students is it’s newness, and at the same time, its eternity and antiquity. As every morning offers the new day, so too does Rome offer a new life, new beauty to our souls, a new home, and an intimate encounter with our God. Dr. Connell advised us to be attentive to the newness around us, and to begin every day with the heart to know and seek the eternal city. I have particulary noticed a kind of joy in the mornings at Mass in St. Peters–from the huge, rotund cherubs holding up the massive holy water dish, to the sweet nuns inviting us to come back the next day, to a cardinal blessing a bride and groom’s marriage at the side altar next to us.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	p		There is one thing, however, that could rival the view of St. Peters for the “Best Part of the New Villa” award. This arrangement is the reason Joe and Owen have checked in YES for every meal of the semester. Mr. Assaf is cooking all of the meals for us. Every, single, meal. And yes, each meal is the best meal any of us have ever eaten. What usually happens is someone says, “my favorite dish that Mr. Assaf makes is..” and they end up listing six different meals. Truly, breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you would be a fool to miss any of it.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	p		Even on rainy days, gelaterias are open and Carlo Menta’s has the best 3 euro pizzas. The view from the Angelicum is beautiful, the view from the top of St. Peter’s–spectacular. Even from the roof of our own villa, the view is pretty incredible. The joy of Rome knows no end–each day is a delight.

http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	a			The End: The Beautiful Changes
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p			I have spent the past few weeks worrying over whether or not Rome has changed me enough. I don’t feel changed. I feel exactly the same as I did in January. I am a little more traveled, and there are a few more memories in my head. But that’s it.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		 It has taken me a lot of thought, but I think I know now what they meant when they said Rome changes you. She does not change you in one great epiphany… At least, that is not how she has changed me. Rome changes you in the little ways, in moments, in people, in experiences, in verses from a poem. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	p		 She changes you as you tiptoe up the side aisle of St. Paul outside the walls, lost in immensity and grandeur. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you enter the warm intimacy of San Benedetto and breathe in the smell of earth and time. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you stand in a starlit St Peter’s Square at six in the morning, watching the seagulls drift overhead. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		 She changes you as you slurp your first (or fifty-first cappuccino.) 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you climb the treacherous hill to the Villa.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you try to call your family and realize that they are still asleep and very far away. As you read your favorite Wilbur poem, bathing in the sound of fountains and birdsong on a sunny piazza.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		 She changes you as you wander the streets of Trastevere lead by a man who knows and loves this city like a dear friend. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you sit in the Olive Grove, breathing in the sunset and listening to the tolling of church bells. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you see her lights filling the Tiber by Ponte San Angelo.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you look at the Forum and find your own life reflected there.
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you see her horizons as something familiar but always new. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure		As you pursue new streets, turn new corners, meet new people, say new things, think new thoughts, open new doors…
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	p		Rome happens gently. 
http://rome.thomasmorecollege.edu	p	figure	br	And she changes you in small ways… beautiful changes.
