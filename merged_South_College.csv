http://www.southcollegetn.edu	h2			 Success at South College
http://www.southcollegetn.edu	p	div		 I chose South College because it came highly recommended from mentors of mine, the faculty is second to none, and the program fits my ever-changing lifestyle. I also chose it because of the flexibility. My wife is still serving in the United States Air Force on Active Duty, and this means that we move when they tell us to move.
http://www.southcollegetn.edu	div	p		 - Shawn Domm, Doctor of Physical Therapy
http://www.southcollegetn.edu	p	div		 One of the major reasons I chose South College was for the smaller class sizes. It allows more one-on-one time between students and professors, which enhances the learning experience for me.
http://www.southcollegetn.edu	div	p		 - Elizabeth Frerichs, Bachelor of Science in Health Science
http://www.southcollegetn.edu	p	div		 I went to college originally straight out of high school with the intent of majoring in musical performance with a concentration in theoretical studies. I was not prepared to for college at that point, so I decided to gain some experience and maturity by joining the work force full-time. After working for 10 years, I felt it was time to try school again.
